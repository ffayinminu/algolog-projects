# Spacer — Lite Distribution Assembly Line
## Powered by Algolog's Distribution Framework + Alex Hormozi's $100M Leads

**Product:** Spacer (spacer.so)
**Category:** Category Two — Product Already Built
**Owner:** Michael (distribution lead), Femi (proposals & closing), Yasmin (setter/warming)
**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

> **Core Formula:** Engaged Leads = (Core Four) x (Volume) x (Skill) x (Lead Getters)
> **Health Check:** LTGP:CAC >= 3:1 | Payback <= 30 days | Referrals > Churn

**Spacer Health Check (Current Estimate):**

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **LTGP** | ~NGN 1,800,000 (avg deal NGN 2.5M, ~30% delivery cost = NGN 1.75M profit, single purchase so far — no recurring yet) | NGN 3,000,000+ (as recurring maintenance/support packages develop) |
| **CAC** | ~NGN 0 (Kay-Wi, Saadatu's, Alegre — all acquired via warm referrals with zero ad spend) | < NGN 500,000 when paid ads begin |
| **LTGP:CAC** | Effectively infinite (zero-cost acquisition via trust networks) | >= 3:1 once paid channels are active |
| **Payback** | Immediate (payment on contract signing / milestone) | <= 30 days |
| **Referrals > Churn** | Kay-Wi came from Saadatu's deployment (1 referral, 0 churn) | Every deployment generates >= 1 referral |

> **Diagnostic:** LTGP:CAC is infinite because acquisition has been free — but volume is low. This is a Layer 1 problem (not enough attention), not a business model problem. The economics are excellent. The bottleneck is reach.

---

> **Lite philosophy:** Full firepower on getting attention. Minimum viable infrastructure to convert, deliver, and collect proof. Graduate to the full template when downstream layers become the bottleneck.

---

## Layer 1 — Attention

**Goal:** As many eyeballs as possible using the Core Four

Do them in order: (1) Warm Outreach → (2) Content → (3) Cold Outreach → (4) Paid Ads

### Phase 0: Foundation

Nail these before any outreach begins.

#### 0.1 — Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Primary ICP** | Serviced apartment operators, hotel owners, co-working space managers in Nigerian cities (Abuja, Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt) |
| **Secondary ICP** | Event venues, student hostels, short-let apartment managers, resort operators |
| **Business Size** | 1-50 units/rooms/spaces. Owner-managed or small management team. Usually 1-5 staff handling bookings |
| **Revenue Range** | NGN 2M-50M/year in booking revenue |
| **Trigger Events** | Just opened a new property, expanding to multiple units, losing bookings to disorganization, getting complaints about access/check-in, seeing competitors use tech, growing too fast for WhatsApp/Excel |
| **Decision Maker** | Property owner or operations manager. Usually the same person at this scale |
| **Pain Signals** | "We manage bookings on WhatsApp", "We've had double-bookings", "We don't know our occupancy rate", "Guests complain about check-in", "We can't track payments properly", "We want smart locks but don't know how" |

#### 0.2 — The Offer

**Offer Statement (Hormozi format):**
"We help serviced apartment and hospitality operators fill more rooms and manage their properties without the stress of manual bookings, scattered WhatsApp messages, and payment confusion — using a system that's already running in properties across Nigeria."

**Offer Script (Value Equation format):**
"We help [serviced apartment / hotel / co-working space operators] get [a fully automated property — bookings, payments, access codes, and reporting from one dashboard] in [2 weeks from signing] without [hiring more staff, buying expensive hardware, or being technical] and [with live deployments in Kaduna and Abuja already proving it works]."

**Value Equation Breakdown:**

| Element | Spacer's Answer |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Dream Outcome** | A fully automated property — bookings, payments, access codes, and reporting all handled from one dashboard. More bookings, zero double-bookings, guests get access codes automatically |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | Live deployments at Saadatu's Apartments (Kaduna), Kay-Wi Limited (Abuja, NGN 16M deal), Alegre Farms (Bwari). They can see it working in real properties |
| **Time Delay** | 2 weeks from signing to fully live. Staff trained, smart locks configured, dashboard populated |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | We handle all setup. We come on-site. We train your team. You don't need to be technical. No hardware to buy (smart locks are affordable and we configure them) |

#### 0.3 — Pricing & Packages

|---------|----------------|------------------------|

| **Outcome Promise** | "Spacer gives you one dashboard for everything — bookings, payments, access codes, reports. Your guests get a premium experience. Your team gets their time back." |
| **Social Proof** | "Already managing 500+ bookings monthly across properties in Abuja and Kaduna. Including a NGN 16M enterprise deployment for Kay-Wi Limited." |
| **Risk Reversal** | "We set it up, we train your team, and we support you for 6-12 months. If it doesn't work, we keep working until it does." |
| **Differentiation** | "This isn't a generic hotel booking system built overseas. Spacer was built for how Nigerian hospitality businesses actually operate — Paystack payments, WhatsApp notifications, walk-in guests, and the realities of managing staff in this market." |

### #1 Warm Outreach — Start Here

Reach out to people who already know you. 100/day. Use ACA (Acknowledge - Compliment - Ask) when they reply. After 3-4 exchanges, make the offer indirectly. First 5 free for testimonials, then price ramp every 5 customers.

#### Warm Outreach Steps

| Step | Action | Spacer-Specific Detail | Done? |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Build your warm contact list** | Go through phone contacts, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn. Tag anyone connected to hospitality, property, real estate. Include: existing clients (Saadatu's, Kay-Wi, Alegre, Yanna), client-adjacent contacts (contractors, electricians, interior designers who visit properties), personal network property owners, real estate agents, church/community connections (via Pledged outreach), previous prospects, connectors like Imran. **Aim for 500+ names.** | |
| 2 | **Segment the list** | A-tier: people who own/manage properties directly. B-tier: people who know property owners (real estate agents, contractors, designers). C-tier: general network who might know someone | |
| 3 | **Send the opener (not a pitch)** | "Hey [Name], hope you're doing well. Quick question..." Wait for reply. Do NOT pitch in first message | |
| 4 | **ACA when they reply** | **Acknowledge** their response, **Compliment** something genuine, **Ask** the indirect question | |
| 5 | **Indirect ask** | "Do you know anyone running a serviced apartment or short-let who's struggling with managing bookings and payments? We've built a system that handles all of it — and we're looking for 5 more properties to onboard this quarter. Anyone come to mind?" | |
| 6 | **If they say themselves** | "That's great — I'd love to hear more about how you're running things. Can I send you a quick case study of what we did for a property in Kaduna? No pressure at all, just thought it might be useful." | |
| 7 | **If they refer someone** | "Amazing, thank you. Would you be comfortable making an intro? Or I can reach out directly and mention you recommended I get in touch." | |
| 8 | **Free offer (first 5)** | "I'll set everything up for free — dashboard, payment integration, smart locks, train your staff. All I ask is that you use it, give me honest feedback, and if it works, leave a review. Fair?" | |
| 9 | **Log everything** | Every conversation goes into the Cold Leads Pipeline database. Source = "Warm Outreach." Update status as they move through | |

#### Key Scripts — Spacer Specific

**Opener (WhatsApp/DM):**
> "Hey [Name]! Hope everything's going well. Quick question for you — do you know anyone in Abuja/Lagos/Kaduna running serviced apartments or short-lets? Trying to connect with a few property managers."

**Indirect Ask (after ACA):**
> "We built a booking and property management system called Spacer — it handles reservations, payments, guest access codes, the whole thing from one dashboard. Already running in a few properties in Kaduna and Abuja. Do you know anybody who might find that useful?"

**Free Offer:**
> "Tell you what — if they're interested, I'll set the whole thing up for free. Dashboard, Paystack payments, smart locks configured, staff trained. All they have to do is use it, give me feedback, and leave an honest review if it works. Sound fair?"

**After Referral:**
> "Thank you, I really appreciate that. Would you mind making a quick intro? Even a simple 'Hey, my friend works with a company that does property management tech, you should chat' — that would mean a lot."

### #2 Post Free Content

Every piece follows Hook - Retain - Reward. The audience is the asset, not the content. Give until they ask. 100 minutes/day. Content compounds and makes all other methods work better.

#### Content Steps

| Step | Action | Spacer-Specific Detail | Done? |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Pick your platforms** | Priority order: Instagram (hospitality operators are visual, they browse here), Twitter/X (tech and business audience), LinkedIn (B2B and property management companies), YouTube Shorts / TikTok (demo clips, property tours) | |

| 3 | **Create your content calendar** | See weekly template below. 1 post/day minimum. Batch-create on weekends if needed | |
| 4 | **Build a swipe file** | Save every piece of content you see from hospitality tech companies, property managers, Airbnb hosts. Study what gets engagement | |
| 5 | **Record deployment footage** | Every time you're on-site at a property (Saadatu's, Kay-Wi, Alegre, Yanna), record: dashboard in use, smart lock in action, staff using the system, before/after comparisons. This is your highest-value content | |
| 6 | **Engage daily** | 100 minutes/day: 30 min creating, 30 min engaging with hospitality accounts (commenting on hotel owners, property managers, real estate pages), 40 min responding to comments/DMs on your posts | |
| 7 | **Repurpose aggressively** | One deployment video = 1 Reel + 1 TikTok + 1 Twitter thread + 1 LinkedIn post + 3 Stories + 1 carousel breakdown | |
| 8 | **Track what works** | Log every post in the Core Four Daily Tracker. Which hooks got the most saves/shares? Double down on those | |

#### Content Calendar — Weekly Template

| Day | Content Type | Platform | Example |
|-----|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Monday** | Pain Point post | Instagram carousel / Twitter thread | "5 signs your serviced apartment needs a booking system (not another WhatsApp group)" |
| **Tuesday** | Product Demo | Instagram Reel / TikTok | 30-second screen recording: "Watch a guest get their smart lock code automatically after booking" |
| **Wednesday** | Social Proof | All platforms | "500+ bookings processed this month across our properties. Here's what the dashboard looks like" |
| **Thursday** | Education | LinkedIn / Twitter | "The real cost of a double-booking for a serviced apartment (it's not just the refund)" |
| **Friday** | Behind the Scenes | Instagram Stories / TikTok | "Setting up Spacer at a new property in [City] today" — on-site footage |
| **Saturday** | Pain Point or Product | Best performing platform | Repurpose best-performing post from the week in a different format |
| **Sunday** | Engagement day | All platforms | Reply to comments, DM new followers, engage with hospitality accounts |

#### Hook - Retain - Reward Examples (Spacer)

**Post 1: Pain Point**
- **Hook:** "A hotel in Abuja lost NGN 800K last month. Not to theft. To double-bookings."
- **Retain:** Story of what happens when two guests show up to the same room. Step by step.
- **Reward:** "Here's the one system setting that makes it physically impossible to double-book."

**Post 2: Product Demo**
- **Hook:** "Your guest just booked. Watch what happens next." (screen recording)
- **Retain:** Show the booking flow -> automatic invoice -> smart lock code generated -> code sent to guest via WhatsApp -> guest walks in
- **Reward:** "That entire process took 0 seconds of staff time."

**Post 3: Social Proof**
- **Hook:** "This property manager used to spend 3 hours a day on WhatsApp managing bookings."
- **Retain:** Before/after breakdown — old process vs. Spacer process
- **Reward:** "Now she checks a dashboard once in the morning. The system handles the rest."

**Post 4: Case Study (Kay-Wi)**
- **Hook:** "A property company walked into a building and saw something that made them sign a NGN 16M deal."
- **Retain:** Tell the Kay-Wi story — Saadatu's deployment -> Kay-Wi observes -> inquiry -> proposal -> deal
- **Reward:** "Your property is either a showroom for your competence or evidence of your chaos. Which one is it?"

**Post 5: Education (Trending)**
- **Hook:** "Nigerian short-lets are growing 40% year over year. Most operators are still running on WhatsApp."
- **Retain:** What happens when you grow from 3 units to 10 units on WhatsApp — the chaos, the missed bookings, the angry guests
- **Reward:** "The operators who automate early are the ones who scale. Here's the minimum tech stack you need."

#### Content Rules

1. **Give until they ask.** Don't pitch in content. Show the product working. Show the results. People will DM you.
2. **Every piece must have a hook in the first line/frame.** If they don't stop scrolling, nothing else matters.
3. **Repurpose aggressively.** One deployment video = 1 Reel + 1 TikTok + 1 Twitter thread + 1 LinkedIn post + 3 Stories + 1 carousel breakdown.
4. **Engage with hospitality accounts.** Comment on posts by hotel owners, property managers, real estate pages. Be helpful, not salesy.
5. **Content compounds.** Month 1 will feel like nothing is happening. By month 3, inbound DMs start. By month 6, content is your highest-quality lead source.

### #3 Cold Outreach

Private, precise, scalable. Build a list of strangers, send personalized messages offering Big Fast Value (stuff they actually pay for). Multi-touch across channels. Expect 9-12 months to full scale.

#### Cold Outreach Steps

| Step | Action | Spacer-Specific Detail | Done? |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Build your target list** | Sources: Google Maps ("serviced apartments [city]", "short-let apartments [city]", "hotels [city]" — Abuja, Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, PH → 200-500 per city), Instagram hashtags (#servicedapartments, #shortletabuja, #shortletlagos, #abujaapartments → 100-300 accounts), Booking.com/Airbnb Nigerian listings (100-200), PropertyPro / Nigeria Property Centre (100-200), WhatsApp real estate groups, LinkedIn ("hospitality manager Nigeria", "property manager Abuja" → 100-200), Industry events (20-50 per event). **Existing lists:** abuja_50_apartments.xlsx, abuja_150_additional_apartments.csv in context folder | |
| 2 | **Personalize every message** | Reference their specific property name, something from their Instagram/website, their location. Never send generic blasts | |
| 3 | **Offer Big Fast Value** | Don't just ask for a meeting. Offer something they'd normally pay for: Free Property Tech Audit (15-min call), Free Occupancy Analysis (review their Booking.com listing), Free Smart Lock Consultation | |

| **Free Occupancy Analysis** | Review their Booking.com/Airbnb listing + Instagram and estimate their occupancy rate vs. market | Shows expertise. Surfaces the gap between where they are and where they could be |
| **Free Smart Lock Consultation** | Walk them through smart lock options, costs, and how automated access codes work | Solves a real curiosity. Positions Spacer as the brain behind the locks |

---

### #4 Paid Ads — Do This LAST

Skills from the other 3 transfer here. Track everything, lose money testing, find the winner, scale it. Best free content often makes the best ads.

#### Paid Ads Steps

| Step | Action | Spacer-Specific Detail | Done? |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Don't start here** | Only begin paid ads AFTER Warm Outreach, Content, and Cold Outreach are running consistently and you know which messages/hooks/offers convert. You need data from organic first | |
| 2 | **Pick your winning content** | Look at your Content tracker — which posts got the most saves, shares, DMs? Those hooks and formats become your first ad creatives | |
| 3 | **Choose platform** | Start with **Meta (Instagram/Facebook)** — hospitality operators browse Instagram. Target: property managers, hotel owners, Airbnb hosts in Nigerian cities. Secondary: **Google Ads** — people searching "property management system Nigeria", "hotel booking software", "serviced apartment software" | |
| 4 | **Set daily budget** | Start at NGN 5,000-10,000/day (roughly $3-6). Enough to test, not enough to burn through budget before learning | |
| 5 | **Create 3-5 ad variants** | Same offer, different hooks. Test: (A) Pain point hook — "Still managing bookings on WhatsApp?", (B) Social proof hook — "500+ bookings processed monthly across Nigerian properties", (C) Demo hook — video of Spacer dashboard in action, (D) Case study hook — "How a Kaduna apartment automated everything in 2 weeks", (E) Smart lock hook — "Your guests get their access code automatically. No more waiting." | |
| 6 | **Set up tracking** | Every ad must point to ONE clear CTA — either "Book a Free Property Tech Audit" or "See the Case Study". Track: click-through rate, cost per lead, cost per booked call | |
| 7 | **Run for 2 weeks, measure** | Kill underperformers after 3-5 days. Double budget on winners. Target: cost per booked call < NGN 50,000 (which keeps LTGP:CAC well above 3:1 at NGN 2M deal size) | |
| 8 | **Scale the winner** | Once you find an ad that produces calls at acceptable cost, increase budget gradually (20% per week). Don't 10x overnight | |

#### Paid Ads Targeting (Spacer)

| Platform | Targeting | Ad Format |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Meta (Instagram)** | Interest: hospitality, hotel management, Airbnb, real estate, property management. Location: Abuja, Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, Port Harcourt. Age: 28-55 | Reels (video demo), Carousel (before/after), Single image (stat + CTA) |
| **Meta (Facebook)** | Same targeting + Facebook Groups related to Nigerian hospitality/real estate | Link ads pointing to case study or booking page |
| **Google Search** | Keywords: "property management software Nigeria", "hotel booking system", "serviced apartment software", "short let management app" | Text ads with case study/demo CTA |
| **Google Display** | Retargeting website visitors (spacer.so) + similar audiences | Banner ads with social proof |

#### Paid Ads Budget & Economics

| Metric | Conservative | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Daily spend | NGN 5,000 | NGN 10,000 |
| Monthly spend | NGN 150,000 | NGN 300,000 |
| Cost per click | NGN 100-300 | NGN 150 |
| Cost per lead (contact info) | NGN 5,000-15,000 | NGN 8,000 |
| Cost per booked call | NGN 30,000-80,000 | NGN 40,000 |
| Cost per closed deal | NGN 200,000-500,000 | NGN 300,000 |
| **LTGP:CAC at NGN 300K CAC** | **~6:1** (at NGN 1.8M LTGP) | **>= 3:1** |

> **Key insight:** Even at conservative paid ad conversion rates, the economics work because Spacer deals are NGN 2M+ with high margins. You can afford to spend up to NGN 600K acquiring a customer and still hit 3:1 LTGP:CAC.

> **DO NOT START PAID ADS** until Phases 1-3 have been running for at least 4-6 weeks and you have clear data on which messages, hooks, and lead magnets convert best organically. Paid ads amplify what already works — they don't fix what doesn't.

### Core Four Daily Tracker

**Your Rule of 100 log.** Every day, log what you did across active channels. Compare *Actions Done* vs *Target* to stay accountable. When you spot a bottleneck, write it in *Constraint Found* — that becomes your next Scaling Experiment below.

#### Tracker Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | Today's date |
| **Channel** | Warm Outreach / Content / Cold Outreach / Paid Ads |
| **Actions Done** | Number of actions completed today (messages sent, posts published, emails sent, ad spend) |
| **Target** | Rule of 100 target for this channel |
| **Replies / Engagement** | How many people responded or engaged |
| **Leads Generated** | How many new leads entered the Cold Leads Pipeline |
| **Constraint Found** | What bottleneck did you notice? (e.g., "running out of warm contacts", "Instagram DMs getting flagged", "email reply rate dropped to 1%") |
| **Notes** | Anything notable — best conversation of the day, new insight, pattern observed |

#### Spacer Daily Targets (Rule of 100)

| Channel | Daily Target | Who | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----|-------|
| **Warm Outreach** | 100 messages/day | Yasmin (primary), Femi (support) | Priority channel. Start here. |
| **Content** | 100 minutes/day | Michael (primary), Femi (support) | 30 min creating, 30 min engaging, 40 min responding |
| **Cold Outreach** | 100 emails + 20 DMs + 10 WhatsApp = 130/day | Yasmin (emails), Femi (DMs/WhatsApp) | Start after warm outreach is running. Use Google Apps Script for email volume |
| **Paid Ads** | NGN 5,000-10,000 daily spend | Michael | Start LAST. Only after Phases 1-3 are producing |

> **YOU NEED TO INPUT:** Actual daily entries. This tracker should be filled out every working day once channels are live. Consider setting this up as a Notion database for easy daily logging.

---

### Scaling: More -> Better -> New

When a channel is running, grow it **in this order:**

| Phase | What to do | Move on when... |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **MORE** | Increase volume of what already works | Volume stops producing proportional results |
| **BETTER** | Find the constraint, test 1 variable/week | Can't beat the control in 4 tests -> constraint is elsewhere |
| **NEW** | New placements -> new platforms -> new Core Four method | Only after MORE and BETTER are exhausted |

#### Scaling Experiments — Spacer

Log every test below. One variable at a time. *Constraint Found* from the Daily Tracker above feeds directly into experiments here.

| # | Date | Channel | Variable Tested | Control | Variant | Result | Winner | Next Action |
|---|------|---------|----------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | | Warm Outreach | Opener message | Current "quick question" opener | New opener referencing a specific local property or news item | | | |
| 2 | | Cold Email | Subject line | "Quick question about [Property Name]" | "How [Property Name] compares to automated properties in [City]" | | | |
| 3 | | Cold Email | Lead magnet in first touch vs. second touch | Case study offer in email 1 | "5 Revenue Leaks" checklist in email 1 | | | |
| 4 | | Content | Hook style | Pain point hook ("Lost NGN 800K to double-bookings") | Curiosity hook ("What happened when we installed smart locks at this apartment") | | | |
| 5 | | Instagram DM | Message type | Text-only DM | Video DM (30-sec personal intro + property compliment) | | | |

> **YOU NEED TO INPUT:** Actual test results as you run experiments. Start with one experiment per week per active channel. Only change one variable at a time.

---

### Lead Magnets Registry

**Your bait arsenal.** Every Core Four method needs something to offer — this is what turns attention into contact info. Track what's live, what people accept (Take Rate %), and what pulls them toward your core offer (Conversion to Core %).

| # | Lead Magnet | Format | Status | Channel Used In | Take Rate % | Conversion to Core % | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| 1 | "5 Revenue Leaks Every Serviced Apartment Has" | 1-2 page PDF checklist | **TO CREATE** | Cold email, content, ads | — | — | Priority #1 to create. Quick win — can be written in 1 hour |
| 2 | "Free Property Tech Audit" | 15-min live call/WhatsApp | **READY** | Warm outreach, cold DMs | — | — | No asset needed — just offer the call. Highest conversion expected |
| 3 | "Saadatu's Apartments Case Study" | PDF or video walkthrough | **TO CREATE** | Cold email, content, ads | — | — | Priority #2. Use real deployment photos + before/after numbers |
| 4 | "What Smart Locks Actually Cost (And Save) For a 10-Unit Property" | 1-page breakdown PDF | **TO CREATE** | Content, ads | — | — | High curiosity factor — smart locks are the "wow" feature |
| 5 | "Live Spacer Dashboard Preview" | Screen recording or live walkthrough | **READY** | Warm outreach, engaged leads | — | — | Use for leads who are already interested but haven't committed to a call |

> **YOU NEED TO INPUT:** Take Rate % and Conversion to Core % once lead magnets are live and you're tracking responses. Update weekly.

---

### Cold Leads Pipeline

**Layer 1 output — where people land.** Everyone your Core Four activities touch goes here. Track their journey: New -> Contacted -> Replied -> Engaged. The Source Method field ties each lead back to which Core Four channel produced them. When a lead hits "Engaged" + Lead Magnet Sent, they're ready for Layer 2 warming below.

#### Pipeline Structure

## Layer 2 — Warming

**Goal:** Convert cold attention into warm, qualified leads.

Low trust sources (paid, outreach) -> need warming. High trust (organic, referral) -> can skip.

### Layer 2 Setup Steps

| Step | Action | Spacer-Specific Detail | Done? |
|------|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 | **Define your warming CTA** | The ONE thing a warmed lead should do: **Book a solution development call with Femi + Michael.** Not "learn more." Not "check the website." Book the call | |
| 2 | **Assign your setter(s)** | **Yasmin Umar** — primary setter. Handles inbound engagement, runs ACA conversations, light qualification, surfaces objections, pushes toward booking the call. Uses the Setter Call Flow Playbook (already created) | |
| 3 | **Set up response protocols** | Inbound DM/email reply -> Yasmin responds within 2 hours during business hours. Weekend inquiries -> Monday morning first thing. No lead waits more than 24 hours for a response | |
| 4 | **Create your warming sequence** | For leads from cold sources (cold email reply, paid ad click): Day 0: Acknowledge + send lead magnet. Day 2: Follow up on lead magnet — "Did you get a chance to look at the case study?" Day 5: Offer the Free Property Tech Audit — "Would a quick 15-min call be useful?" Day 7: Light social proof — "Just deployed at another property in [City] this week." Day 10: Direct ask — "Would [Day] or [Day] work for a 20-min call with our team?" | |
| 5 | **Build qualification criteria** | Qualified = (1) Owns/manages a property with 3+ bookable units, (2) Currently using manual/WhatsApp process, (3) Has expressed interest or pain, (4) Decision-maker or has access to one. If all 4: book the call. If missing (4): ask "Who makes decisions about systems for the property?" and get their contact | |
| 6 | **Set up meeting booking flow** | Yasmin offers 2 specific time slots. Gets confirmation. Sends calendar invite. Notifies Femi + Michael. Sends reminder 1 day before. If no-show: follows up same day + next day (max 2 attempts) | |

#### Setter Rules (Spacer-Specific)

**Setters = distribution labor, NOT sales labor.**

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Engage with every inbound reply within 2 hours | Close deals |
| Run ACA conversations (Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask) | Handle money or invoicing |
| Light qualification (property size, current system, decision-maker) | Make promises about pricing or timelines |
| Surface objections and log them | Give specific pricing numbers |
| Push toward ONE CTA: book the solution development call | Negotiate or offer discounts |
| Log every interaction in the Warm Leads pipeline | Send any document not pre-approved |

**Setter Metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Appointments booked / day | 1-2 |
| Show-up rate | 70%+ |
| Response time (business hours) | < 2 hours |
| Cost per appointment | NGN 0 (organic) or < NGN 30,000 (paid) |

> **Setup steps** = build your warming system (one-time). **Tracker below** = log every lead as they warm up toward a sales conversation (ongoing).

### Warm Leads Pipeline

Track every lead that has moved past "Engaged" in the Cold Leads Pipeline. These are people who have shown interest and are being warmed toward a solution development call.

## Layer 3+4 — Close & Deliver

**Goal:** Convert warm leads into paying customers, then deliver the result. One database tracks the full journey: Pending -> Won -> Delivered -> Result Achieved.

> The sales rep (Femi + Michael) must do 4 things: **Diagnose** (articulate their problem), **Position** (prove you can solve it), **Handle Objections** (remove concerns), **Close** (clear next step).

### Spacer Sales Process

| Stage | Who | What Happens | Spacer-Specific |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| **Diagnose** | Femi + Michael (solution development call) | Articulate the prospect's problem better than they can | Ask: How do you manage bookings now? How many units? What happens when two guests book the same room? How do you handle payments? Do you know your occupancy rate? How much time does your team spend on booking admin? Have you considered smart locks? |
| **Position** | Femi (proposals), Michael (live demo) | Prove you can solve it — with evidence | Show the live Spacer dashboard (Saadatu's or demo instance). Walk through the booking flow. Show smart lock code generation. Share Kay-Wi case study. Send a customized proposal (use generate_proposals.py or Proposal-PDF-Generator-Prompt.md for Claude web) |
| **Handle Objections** | Femi | Remove concerns without being pushy | See common objections below |
| **Close** | Femi | Clear next step — proposal acceptance + payment | "Based on what we've discussed, here's what I'd recommend for [Property Name]..." Send proposal. Follow up per Setter Call Flow Playbook schedule |

#### Common Spacer Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"It's too expensive"** | "I understand. Let me walk you through what this replaces — the manual hours, the double-booking risks, the payment confusion. Most of our clients find the system pays for itself within the first 3-4 months through reduced errors and improved occupancy. Would it help to see the numbers for a property your size?" |
| **"We already have a system"** | "That's great — what are you using? Is it working well for everything? A lot of our clients switched from [Yanolja/manual systems] because they needed something built for how Nigerian properties actually operate — Paystack payments, WhatsApp notifications, walk-in guests." (Yanna Apartments migration is your proof here) |
| **"We need to think about it"** | "Absolutely, take your time. Would it help if I sent over the case study from Saadatu's Apartments so you can see exactly what the setup looks like in a real property? And when would be a good time for me to follow up?" |
| **"Can we start smaller?"** | "Of course. We have a Starter package at NGN 2M that gives you the core dashboard, booking engine, and payment integration. Smart locks and advanced features can be added later. Would that be a better starting point?" |
| **"How long does setup take?"** | "Two weeks from signing to fully live. We come on-site, handle all the configuration, and train your team. You don't need to be technical at all." |
| **"What if it doesn't work?"** | "We support you for 6-12 months after deployment. If something isn't working, we keep working until it does. Our reputation depends on every deployment being a success — because every property we deploy at becomes a reference for the next one." |

### Value Equation (Spacer-Specific)

**Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)**

| Element | How to Maximize/Minimize | Spacer Proof |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Dream Outcome** (maximize) | State the best possible result clearly: "A fully automated property where bookings, payments, and guest access run themselves." | Saadatu's — staff no longer spends hours on WhatsApp managing bookings. Kay-Wi — automated access codes, zero manual key handoffs |
| **Perceived Likelihood** (maximize) | Reviews, live deployments, guarantees, endorsements | 4 live deployments. 500+ bookings/month. NGN 16M enterprise deal. "Come visit Saadatu's and see it working" |
| **Time Delay** (minimize) | How fast do they get results? | 2 weeks from signing to fully live. Staff trained, smart locks configured, dashboard populated. Immediate impact on day 1 of go-live |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** (minimize) | What do they have to give up or do? | We handle everything. We come on-site. We train the team. They don't need to be technical. No workflow disruption — we set up alongside their existing process |

**Spacer Offer Script:**
> "We help serviced apartment and hospitality operators get a fully automated property — bookings, payments, guest access codes, and reporting from one dashboard — in 2 weeks from signing, without hiring more staff or being technical, and with 4 live deployments already proving it works across Abuja and Kaduna."

### Deals Tracker

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Deal Name** | Property name + owner |
| **Property** | Property details (location, size, type) |
| **Package** | Starter / Professional / Enterprise |
| **Deal Value** | NGN amount |
| **Status** | Pending -> Proposal Sent -> Negotiating -> Won -> Deploying -> Delivered -> Result Achieved |
| **Sales Rep** | Femi / Michael |
| **Proposal Sent Date** | When the proposal went out |
| **Close Date** | When payment was received |
| **Deployment Date** | When Spacer went live |
| **Result Achieved?** | Has the client seen measurable improvement? |
| **Proof Collected?** | Testimonial, case study, referral obtained? |
| **Notes** | Key deal details |

#### Current Deals

| Deal | Location | Package | Value | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Saadatu's Apartments | Kaduna | Professional | NGN 2,000,000 | **Delivered** | Smart locks live. Reference client. Proof asset |
| Kay-Wi Limited | Abuja (Guzape) | Enterprise | NGN 16,000,000 | **Delivered** | Multi-property. Facility mgmt + Spacer. Top reference |
| Alegre Farms | Bwari | Professional | NGN 3,000,000 | **Delivered** | Resort booking platform |
| Yanna Apartments | Abuja | Professional | TBD | **Deploying** | Migrating from Yanolja Cloud |

> **After Won:** Deliver the result. Force wins in the first 48 hours — get the dashboard live, show them their first booking flowing through, get a smart lock code generated. BAMFAM (Book A Meeting From A Meeting) — customer always knows their next touchpoint. When they achieve the result, check **Result Achieved** and move to Proof.

> **Diagnostic:** Sales but refunds? -> Delivery problem. Fix the product before scaling Layer 1.

---

## Layer 5 — Proof

**Goal:** Capture results from delivered deals, deploy as fuel back into Layer 1. More proof -> higher conversion -> more customers -> more proof.

After a deal hits **Result Achieved**, ask for a testimonial and a referral. Log everything here.

### Proof Collected — Spacer

| # | Client | Proof Type | Asset | Status | Deployed To |
|---|--------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Saadatu's Apartments | Live deployment reference | "Fully operational serviced apartment with smart lock automation in Kaduna" | **ACTIVE** | Proposals, in-person visits, content |
| 2 | Saadatu's Apartments | Referral generated | Led directly to the Kay-Wi deal (Kay-Wi observed the deployment on-site) | **USED** | This referral closed a NGN 16M deal |
| 3 | Kay-Wi Limited | Enterprise deal reference | "NGN 16M multi-property deployment covering Spacer + Facility Management + Access Control" | **ACTIVE** | Proposals, case studies, social proof |
| 4 | Kay-Wi Limited | Testimonial | "Algolog didn't just give us software — they understood our operations and gave us a system that actually fits how we work. The difference was immediate." — Property Manager | **ACTIVE** | Proposals, content, ads |
| 5 | Alegre Farms | Resort/leisure deployment reference | "Resort booking platform for a farm/event venue in Bwari" | **ACTIVE** | Proposals targeting leisure/hospitality |
| 6 | Yanna Apartments | Migration case study | "Migrated from Yanolja Cloud (expensive overseas platform) to Spacer (built for Nigeria)" | **IN PROGRESS** | Content about switching platforms — once migration complete |
| 7 | All properties | Volume metric | "500+ bookings/month processed across properties" | **ACTIVE** | Social media, proposals, ads, all outreach |

### Proof Deployment Map (Spacer)

| Proof Type | Where to Deploy |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Testimonials** (Kay-Wi quote, future client quotes) | Proposals (Why Algolog section), content posts, cold outreach emails, ad creatives, website (spacer.so) |
| **Case Studies** (Saadatu's full story, Kay-Wi deal story) | Cold email attachments, content series, ad creatives, lead magnets, proposal appendix |
| **Screenshots/Results** (dashboard screenshots, booking stats, smart lock codes) | Instagram posts, Twitter threads, LinkedIn posts, ad creatives |
| **Video** (deployment day footage, dashboard walkthrough, smart lock demo) | Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, paid ad creatives |
| **Referrals** (anyone a current client refers) | Direct leads -> Layer 2 warming OR straight to Deals if high trust |
| **Live deployments** (physical properties running Spacer) | In-person visits for serious prospects ("Come see it working at Saadatu's / Kay-Wi") |

### The Ask (After Every Delivery)

After a deployment is live and the client is seeing results, ask two things:

1. **"Who else could benefit from this?"** — "Do you know any other property owners or managers who might find a system like this useful? We'd love an introduction."

2. **"Would you leave a quick review?"** — "Would you be comfortable giving us a short testimonial about your experience? Even just 2-3 sentences about what's changed since we deployed. It helps other property managers understand what to expect."

That's it. Don't overcomplicate it. Every deployment should produce at least one referral and one testimonial.

> **Current proof gap:** No video content from live deployments. Priority: record dashboard walkthrough at Saadatu's or Kay-Wi. This single asset can fuel weeks of content + ad creative.

---

## Layer 6 — Diagnostic

No tracking database in lite mode. Just this reference — when something isn't working, find the bottleneck:

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix (Spacer-Specific) |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **No traffic?** | Layer 1 problem | Are you actually doing 100/day? Check Daily Tracker. If warm contacts are exhausted, activate Cold Outreach. If cold isn't working, check messaging (test new subject lines, hooks). If content isn't getting views, study what hospitality accounts get engagement and adapt |
| **Traffic but no leads?** | Layer 1 problem | Lead magnet isn't compelling. Test a new one. "5 Revenue Leaks" not working? Try "Free Property Tech Audit" or "Saadatu's Case Study." Or: the offer isn't clear enough. Simplify the CTA |
| **Leads but no sales?** | Layer 2-3 problem | Not warm enough (setter not following up fast enough — check response time) OR offer isn't strong (check Value Equation — is the dream outcome clear? Is perceived likelihood high enough?). Send leads the Kay-Wi case study before the call. Offer the Free Tech Audit to build trust |
| **Sales but refunds / unhappy clients?** | Layer 4 problem | Delivery issue. Is the 2-week deployment timeline realistic for this property size? Is staff training thorough enough? Is the dashboard intuitive enough? Fix the product before scaling attention |
| **No growth flywheel?** | Layer 5 problem | Not collecting proof. Are you asking every deployed client for a testimonial and referral? Record deployment footage. Write up case studies. The Kay-Wi deal literally came from the proof loop — feed it |
| **Don't know what's broken?** | Measurement problem | Graduate to the full template for proper Layer 6 tracking. Set up the Notion databases (Daily Tracker, Cold Leads, Warm Leads, Deals, Proof). Without data, you're guessing |

### Current Spacer Diagnosis (February 2026)

| Layer | Status | Bottleneck? |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Layer 1 (Attention)** | Low volume. 4 deals all from warm/trust networks. No cold outreach active. No content engine running. No paid ads | **YES — PRIMARY BOTTLENECK.** Not enough eyeballs. The economics are excellent (infinite LTGP:CAC) but volume is too low |
| **Layer 2 (Warming)** | Yasmin is effective at relationship warming (proved in Kay-Wi) but not yet running structured setter process at volume | Not yet — will become bottleneck when Layer 1 scales |
| **Layer 3 (Sales)** | Femi + Michael close effectively when they get in front of prospects (100% close rate on deals that reach proposal stage) | No — sales capability is strong |
| **Layer 4 (Delivery)** | 4 successful deployments. 2-week timeline. On-site training. No delivery issues reported | No — delivery works |
| **Layer 5 (Proof)** | Strong proof assets (Kay-Wi NGN 16M, Saadatu's, Alegre, 500+ bookings). Missing: video content, written case studies, systematic referral collection | Not primary, but under-deployed. Proof exists but isn't being pushed into Layer 1 aggressively enough |

> **Recommended action:** Solve the Layer 1 bottleneck. Activate Warm Outreach (Phase 1) immediately at 100/day. Start Content (Phase 2) in parallel. Begin Cold Outreach (Phase 3) once the first 2 lead magnets are created. Hold Paid Ads (Phase 4) until Phases 1-3 have been running for 4-6 weeks.

> **When to graduate to full template:** When Layer 1 is consistently producing leads but downstream conversion, fulfillment, or proof becomes the bottleneck. That means attention is solved — time to invest in the machine.
