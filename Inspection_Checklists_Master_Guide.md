### **DURING INSPECTION (ON-SITE):**

**STEP 1: INTRODUCTION (15 minutes)**
- Meet facility manager
- Explain inspection process
- Request escort for restricted areas
- Confirm areas to be inspected

**STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION (3-4 hours)**

Work through each checklist **category by category**:

**RECOMMENDED ORDER:**
1. Generator Health (30 min) - Start with mechanical room
2. Electrical Systems (45 min) - Inspect electrical rooms/panels
3. HVAC Systems (45 min) - Check air handling units
4. Water Systems (30 min) - Test taps, check tanks

9. Medical Equipment Environment (20 min) - Check OR, pharmacy, lab
10. Cleanliness (20 min) - Walk through all areas
11. General Maintenance (30 min) - Building walk-around

**For Each Checklist:**
- Check ☑ or leave blank ☐ for each checkpoint
- Take photos of ALL issues
- Write detailed notes
- Estimate repair costs (ask staff if needed)
- Count checkpoints passed
- Calculate points awarded

**CALCULATION METHOD:**
```
Points Awarded = (Checkpoints Passed / Total Checkpoints) × Max Points

Example:
Item: Oil Quality Check (10 points max)
Checkpoints: 6 total
Passed: 4 checkpoints

Points = (4/6) × 10 = 6.67 ≈ 7 points
```

---

**STEP 3: SUMMARY COMPLETION (30 minutes)**
- Fill in summary page for each checklist
- Calculate total points per category
- Convert to 0-100 score
- Determine status (Excellent/Good/Fair/Critical)
- Write overall findings
- Add recommendations

**CONVERSION TO 100-POINT SCALE:**
```
Category Score = (Total Points Awarded / Maximum Points) × 100

Example:
Category: Generator Health
Maximum Points: 50
Points Awarded: 39

Score = (39/50) × 100 = 78/100 = GOOD
```

**STATUS DETERMINATION:**
- 90-100 = 🟢 EXCELLENT
- 70-89 = 🟡 GOOD
- 50-69 = 🟠 FAIR
- <50 = 🔴 CRITICAL

## 💡 INSPECTION BEST PRACTICES:

### **1. BE SYSTEMATIC:**
- Follow checklist order exactly
- Don't skip checkpoints
- Complete one category before moving to next
- Use systematic path (e.g., ground floor → top floor)

### **2. BE THOROUGH:**
- Actually perform tests (don't just look)
- Test 100% of fire extinguishers
- Check multiple locations for each item
- Ask staff questions about issues
- Take photos of EVERYTHING (good and bad)

### **3. BE ACCURATE:**
- Use actual measurements (thermometer, multimeter)
- Don't estimate if you can measure
- Record exact numbers (not "hot" but "28°C")
- Document dates (oil change, last service, etc.)
- Get quotes for repair costs when possible

### **4. BE FAIR:**
- Award partial points for partial compliance
- Don't be overly harsh or lenient
- Compare to industry standards, not perfection
- Consider facility age and resources
- Note improvements since last inspection

### **5. BE SAFE:**
- Don't test live electrical circuits without training
- Use safety equipment (gloves, mask)
- Don't enter hazardous areas alone
- Get facility escort for restricted areas
- Stop if unsafe conditions exist

- All checkpoints must pass for full points
- Partial compliance = proportional points
- Example: 5 out of 6 checkpoints = 83% of points

**LENIENT (For Encouraging Improvement):**
- Focus on major issues
- Give benefit of doubt on minor items
- Example: 5 out of 6 checkpoints = 90% of points

**RECOMMENDED:** Start STRICT, explain scoring clearly to client, adjust if needed for relationship building.
