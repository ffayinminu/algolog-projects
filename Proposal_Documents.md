*(Specialists in Digital Transformation, Media Engineering & Systems Design)*

## **Introduction: The Opportunity Before 2027**

We’ve heard about your intention to run for office in **Yobe State in 2027** — and as we conducted our background research, we noticed something remarkable:

A man of significant influence, accomplishment, and vision — yet when one searches for you online, there’s little or no centralized presence that reflects your stature.

The current digital footprint — a few scattered mentions and local reports — doesn’t capture **the scale of your experience, your leadership in business, or your contribution to Nigeria’s development**.

And in today’s world, **visibility is viability**.  
 Elections are no longer won by who speaks loudest — but by **who controls the narrative**, **who owns the data**, and **who commands the digital battlefield**.

We live in an age where **media and technology win elections**, shape perception, and create legacy.

That’s where we come in.

## **Our Vision: Building a Digital Legacy Around Kashim Musa Tumsah**

### **1\. The Personal Brand & Legacy Architecture**

**Deliverables:**

* A **personalized website** (e.g., [*www.kashimmusatumsah.com*](http://www.kashimmusatumsah.com/)) that becomes the official hub for your biography, achievements, interviews, and updates.  
* A **professionally written Wikipedia page** (crafted within guidelines, verifiable and citation-backed).  
* A **documentary-style short film** that tells your story — your journey, business legacy, and service to Yobe and Nigeria.  
* International media outreach and syndication through **Internationally recognized outlets**.  
* A **digital press kit** for journalists, partners, and campaign teams.

*This ensures that every journalist, voter, or investor who searches for you — finds a credible, consistent, and inspiring story.*

### **2\. Digital Media Campaign Engine**

**Goal:** Own the narrative. Dominate online conversation.

**Deliverables:**

* A full **social media branding campaign** (Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn).  
* **High-quality photo and video content** produced monthly (lifestyle, interviews, rallies, testimonials).  
* A **media calendar** mapped to election milestones and PR opportunities.  
* Community-driven content showing your connection to the people.  
* Targeted **ad campaigns** (social, YouTube pre-rolls, local display) across Yobe, Nigeria and diaspora networks.

## **Why Algolog**

At **Algolog**, we represent a new generation of innovators — young, creative, and all-round Nigerians, relentlessly driven by the belief that technology and storytelling can redefine leadership in Africa.

You already know us through our work with Alegre Farms and Resort, where we partnered with your team to deliver a complete digital transformation across both technology and brand experience.  Through Spacer (Algolog’s flagship space and hospitality management tool trusted by space operators across Africa, from hotels to service apartments and resorts to co-working hubs), we rebuilt the entire booking flow into a seamless, modern system—introducing smarter space management, automated payments,space bookings, and an elegant gallery inspired by premium resort designs. Alongside this, we designed the Alegre Farms and Resort website into a clean, high-converting platform that showcased the resort’s identity while making bookings easier and more intuitive than ever.

To elevate visibility and strengthen the brand story, we produced a full media campaign: professional photography, drone footage, lifestyle video scenes, and a cinematic social media advert that followed a guest’s journey through the farm. This combined creative and technical overhaul did more than improve operations— it strengthened Alegre’s online presence, boosted trust, and positioned the resort as a standout destination in its category.

 Through that collaboration, we saw firsthand your **commitment to excellence, vision for growth, and belief in innovation**.  
 That same spirit is what inspires this new journey — to translate your achievements, values, and leadership story into a compelling digital and political narrative that resonates across Yobe, Nigeria, and beyond.

We don’t approach this campaign as just another media or software project.  
 We see it as **a partnership to build the digital architecture of your legacy** — one that mirrors your business acumen and commitment to community development.

Our team combines:

* **Strategic thinkers** who understand the pulse of public perception,  
* **Engineers and data experts** who build systems that run with precision, and  
* **Creative storytellers** who know how to make leadership felt and remembered.

We are not outsiders looking in — we are the **next generation of Nigerian innovators**, bringing fresh, intelligent energy into your campaign.  
 Our focus is to merge **youthful creativity with professional excellence**, crafting a media and technology framework that positions you as the modern, forward-thinking leader Yobe deserves.

*With Algolog, your story will not only be told — it will be felt.*  
 *Your campaign will not just compete — it will **lead**.*  
 *And together, we’ll create a digital legacy that inspires the next generation.*

# 

# KAY-WI APARTMENT PROJECT

![][image1]

# **KAY-WI APARTMENT PROJECT**

# **A. Commercial Proposal & Technical Implementation**

# **1\. Executive Summary**

# Algolog proposes the customization and deployment of Spacer as a unified digital operating system for the KAY-WI Apartment Project in Bwari, Abuja. The solution will manage apartment bookings, identity verification, and digital access control across four (4) apartment buildings housing a total of 104 apartments.

# Spacer is positioned as the core, independent product layer responsible for booking governance, resident verification, and access automation. All other capabilities (facility systems, internet infrastructure, utilities, gym monetization) are treated as separate deployments that can be implemented incrementally without preventing Spacer’s immediate adoption.

# Spacer will act as the single source of truth for tenants, access permissions, and booking lifecycle, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability from day one.

# 

# **2\. Project Objectives** The primary objectives of this engagement are to:

* # Digitize apartment booking and allocation processes

* # Enforce mandatory KYC verification before occupancy

* # Implement secure, expiring digital access for buildings and rooms

* # Decouple core booking & access from optional facility integrations

* # Enable phased deployment

* # Deliver a scalable, auditable, and future-ready system

# 

# **3\. Scope of Work (Functional)**

# **3.1 Spacer Core Customization (PRIMARY DEPLOYMENT)** Spacer will be extended to support:

* # Apartment room inventory management (104 rooms)

* # Resident booking workflows

* # Time-bound reservations and renewals

* # Automated email notifications (Door access)

# This represents the minimum viable operational system required to digitize and control the Apartments.

# **3.2 KYC Verification Module (Spacer Core)** A mandatory KYC layer will be implemented within Spacer:

* # ID document upload (Government ID)

* # Identity data capture and verification

* # Permanent KYC status stored per user

# **3.3 Booking, Payment & Access Automation (Spacer Core)** Upon successful KYC and payment:

* # Spacer confirms booking

* # System generates:

  * # Expiring access code for building access

  * # Expiring digital door code for room

* # Single automated email sent to user containing all credentials

* # Codes expire automatically at end of booking period

# **3.4 Access Control & Smart Lock Integration (Spacer Core)**

# **Building Entrances:**

* # TTLock Smartlocks installed at each building entrance

* # Codes validated in real time

# **Apartment Doors:**

* # TTLock smart locks

* # Online code generation

* # Real-time sync with Space

* # Automatic expiration and revocation

# 

# **4\. Separate Deployments (not required for spacer to go-live)**

# These systems are explicitly decoupled from Spacer deployment and should be implemented independently.

# **4.1 Facility Management System** A dedicated Facility Management Module (separate deployment) can track:

* # Electricity consumption

* # Power outage events

* # Maintenance requests

* # Incident reporting and resolution

# Facility Dashboards:

* # Consumption analytics

* # Usage trends

* # Fault alerts

* # Staff assignment and resolution logs

# Note: Gas systems, water metering, or advanced utility automation are quoted separately and do not affect Spacer functionality.

# **4.2 Gym Access & Subscription System**

# **Residents:**

* # Automatic gym access synced to booking duration

# **External Users:**

* # Subscription-based access

* # Online payment

* # Time-bound access codes

# This module can be enabled after core residential operations stabilize.

# **4.3 Internet & Connectivity Infrastructure (Infrastructure Deployment)**

# **Purpose**

# The internet and connectivity infrastructure provides the network layer required for reliable operation of Spacer’s access control ecosystem. While Spacer’s booking and authorization logic is cloud-based, stable and predictable internet connectivity is required to ensure uninterrupted communication between smart lock gateways, QR access devices, and the Spacer platform.

# This infrastructure is designed to:

* # Maintain near real-time synchronization between Spacer and smart lock gateways

* # Prevent access failures caused by network congestion or tenant usage

* # Isolate operational systems from resident internet traffic

* # Enable secure, scalable, and fault-isolated connectivity across all buildings

# **Per-Building Network Isolation**

# Each building operates as an independent network zone with its own internet uplinks and control equipment. This design ensures that faults, congestion, or maintenance activities in one building do not impact access control operations in other buildings.

# **Starlink Internet Backbone**

# Two (2) Starlink units per building

# **Design Rationale:**

# Each Starlink connection serves a distinct operational purpose rather than acting as a combined bandwidth pool. This approach prioritizes reliability, traffic isolation, and predictable performance over raw throughput aggregation.

# 

# **Operational Allocation:**

#  **Starlink A**: Dedicated operational connectivity  

* #   Smart lock gateways  

* #   QR access devices  

* #   Spacer administrative and monitoring traffic  

# **Starlink B**: Tenant internet access (optional, rate-limited, and isolated)

# 

# **Traffic Handling:**

* # Policy-based routing is used to ensure operational traffic always traverses the dedicated operational link

* # Automatic failover can be configured to maintain connectivity during uplink interruptions

# **Benefits:**

* # Prevents tenant usage from impacting access control reliability

* # Enables deterministic performance for access operations

* # Simplifies fault isolation, troubleshooting, and SLA enforcement

* # Reduces operational risk during peak tenant usage periods

# **Edge Router & Network Control Layer**

# One (1) enterprise-grade edge router per building

# **Purpose:**

# The edge router functions as the central traffic management, security, and segmentation layer for the building.

# **Core Functions:**

* # Policy-based routing across independent internet uplinks

* # Automatic failover handling

* # Bandwidth prioritization (QoS) for access control systems

* # Network segmentation using VLANs

* # Firewall enforcement and security rule management

# **Why This Is Required:**

# Without a dedicated edge router, all devices compete equally for bandwidth, increasing the risk of delayed lock synchronization, failed access commands, and reduced system reliability. The router ensures access control traffic remains prioritized and isolated at all times.

# **Internal WiFi Distribution**

# Enterprise-grade wireless access points deployed per floor

# **Design Logic:**

* # Centralized placement per floor for uniform coverage

* # Mesh-capable architecture to allow automatic rerouting if an access point fails

* # High concurrent device support for residents, staff, and IoT devices

# **Baseline Deployment:**

* # Three (3) access points per floor

* # Three (3) floors per building

* # Nine (9) access points per building

* # Thirty-six (36) access points across four (4) buildings

# **Benefits:**

* # Eliminates coverage dead zones

* # Supports seamless roaming across floors

* # Prevents signal saturation under high concurrent usage

# **Network Segmentation (VLAN Architecture)**

# Logical separation of all network traffic is enforced using VLANs.

# **Recommended Segments:**

* # Access Control & Smart Lock Gateways

* # Spacer Admin & Facility Management Systems

* # Tenant Internet

* # Guest / Public WiFi

# **Benefits:**

* # Ensures tenant traffic cannot impact access control systems

* # Improves overall security posture

* # Simplifies troubleshooting and future system expansion

# **Phase 2: Hardware Rollout**

* # Apartment smartlocks

* # Entrance smartlocks

# **Phase 3: Other Systems**

* # Gym system

* # Facility module

* # Internet infrastructure

# **B. System Deployment Description**

### **KYC Verification Flow**

# **Purpose**: To ensure that only legitimate, identifiable residents can access the Apartment and its facilities.

# **Flow Description:**

1. # The user selects a room-type on Spacer.

2. # Before proceeding to payment, the system requires ID upload.

3. # Accepted IDs:

   * # Government-issued ID

4. # System performs:

   * # Name matching

   * # Image-to-user correlation

5. # Users with completed or pending verification may proceed to payment; however, full access credentials and booking activation are only issued after verification is successfully completed.

# **Goal of This Flow:**

* # Prevent impersonation

* # Eliminate fraudulent bookings

* # Provide legal defensibility

* # Establish a verified resident database

### **Booking & Payment Flow**

# **Purpose**: To ensure bookings are traceable, enforceable, and synchronized with access control.

# **Flow Description:**

1. # Verified user selects room.

2. # Payment is completed via Spacer.

3. # Booking is locked to:

   * # Specific room

   * # Specific dates

4. # The system immediately provisions access credentials.

# **Goal of This Flow**:

* # Prevent double bookings

* # Tie financial transaction directly to physical access

* # Automate occupancy control

### **Digital Access Credential Flow**

# **Purpose:** To eliminate physical keys, reduce theft, and enable remote governance.

# Flow Description: Upon successful booking, Spacer sends one structured email containing:

* # Booking confirmation

* # Apartment door digital code

# 

# **Credential Rules:**

* # Codes activate on check-in date

* # Codes expire automatically on check-out date

* # No manual intervention required

# **Goal of This Flow:**

* # Full automation

* # Zero key management

* # Time-bound access

* # Reduced human error

## **Access Control Architecture (Detailed)**

### **Building Entrance Access System**

# **Purpose:** To prevent unauthorized entry into Apartment buildings.

# **Flow Description:**

* # QR code scanned at entrance

* # Spacer validates:

  * # User identity

  * # Booking validity

* # Door unlocks if valid

# **Goal:**

* # Secure buildings at all times

* # Log every entry

* # Prevent tailgating abuse

### **Apartment Door Lock System**

# **Purpose:** To provide individual, auditable room access.

# **Selected Lock Class**: TTLock Smart Locks (Cloud-Synced, Online Code Enabled)

# **How It Works:**

* # Spacer generates code

* # Code syncs via TTLock cloud

* # Lock accepts code only during valid period

* # Code expires automatically

# **Goal:**

* # Full lifecycle access control

* # Eliminate key loss

* # Enable emergency overrides

* # Remote access revocation

### 

### **Tuya Device Limit & Account Architecture Rationale (This section is only relevant if the Client must employ Tuya locks – Algolog advises TTLock smart locks instead)**

# **Purpose**

# To ensure system stability, real-time synchronization, and uninterrupted access control operations across all apartment doors.

# **Explanation of the 20-Device Limit**

# Tuya’s cloud infrastructure enforces a **maximum of 20 smart devices per account** on its standard (free-tier) deployment.

# **Applied Architecture for KAY-WI**

# Each building contains **26 apartment doors**, which exceeds Tuya’s per-account device threshold.

# To remain within Tuya’s stability limits:

* # **Two (2) Tuya accounts are assigned per building**

  * # Account A: up to 20 locks

  * # Account B: remaining 6 locks

* # Each account is mapped explicitly to Spacer

* # Spacer routes code-generation and expiry logic to the correct account automatically 

# This approach ensures:

* # Full compliance with Tuya cloud constraints

* # Stable, real-time code updates

* # No degradation in lock responsiveness

* # Predictable system behavior at scale 

### **Advised Alternative Lock Option (No 20-Device Limitation)**

# This is a **strongly recommended** option, Algolog advises the deployment of:

# **TTLock Intelligent Life Smart Locks**

# **Key Advantage**

# TTLock’s cloud architecture **does not enforce a strict 20-device-per-account limitation**, allowing:

* # All locks within a building to be managed under a single logical deployment

* # Simplified account management

* # Reduced operational overhead

* # Cleaner integration logic with Spacer

# 

# **Capabilities**

* # Cloud-synced online codes

* # Time-bound access credentials

* # Remote code generation and revocation

* # Gateway-based internet connectivity

* # Stable API integration for automation platforms 

# **Implication for System Design**

# If TTLock is selected (recommended):

* # The multi-account segmentation requirement is removed

* # Gateway deployment focuses purely on physical coverage and signal range

* # Spacer integrates with a unified lock namespace per building 

# This option offers a **cleaner long-term architecture** while preserving all security, automation, and expiry features required for KAY-WI.

## **Gym Access & Subscription Flow (Detailed)**

### **Resident Gym Access**

# **Purpose:** To make the gym a value-added resident facility.

# **Flow:**

* # Spacer automatically assigns gym access to residents

* # Access tied to room booking duration

# **Goal:**

* # No additional admin

* # Seamless resident experience

### **External Gym User Flow**

# **Purpose:** To monetize the gym independently.

# **D. Commercial Structure Summary**

* # Spacer Core will be deployed independently

* # Hardware can be client-procured or Algolog-managed

* # Optional systems can be added incrementally

* # No dependency lock-in

## **E. Facility Management System (FMS) – Detailed Scope**

### **Purpose**

# The Facility Management System (FMS) is designed to give KAY-WI centralized, real-time visibility and control over all operational assets and utilities across the hostel buildings. It converts physical activity (power usage, gas usage, faults, maintenance) into measurable, auditable data, enabling cost control, accountability, and operational optimization.

# The FMS operates as a separate operational module that integrates with Spacer but does not depend on the booking or access system to function.

## **1\. Tracked Systems (How Each Is Implemented)**

### **1.1 Electricity Consumption Tracking**

# **What Is Tracked**

* # Total electricity consumption per building

* # Electricity usage per floor

* # High-load periods (peak vs off-peak)

* # Generator vs grid usage (if applicable)

# 

# **How It Is Captured**

* # Integration with smart energy meters (where available)

* # Manual meter reading entry (fallback option)

* # Periodic data ingestion (hourly / daily)

# **System Outputs**

* # Daily, weekly, and monthly usage charts

* # Cost estimation based on tariff inputs

* # Abnormal usage alerts (sudden spikes)

# **Why This Matters**

* # Identifies wastage or energy leaks

* # Enables budgeting and cost forecasting

* # Supports decisions on energy optimization or upgrades

# 

### **1.2 Gas Distribution Monitoring**

# **What Is Tracked**

* # Gas consumption per building or kitchen cluster

* # Usage trends over time

* # Refill frequency and cost

# **How It Is Captured**

* # Smart gas meter integration (if installed)

* # Manual refill logging with consumption estimation

* # Scheduled usage snapshots

# **System Outputs**

* # Consumption trends

* # Estimated depletion timelines

* # Refill planning alerts

# **Why This Matters**

* # Prevents unexpected shortages

* # Improves safety oversight

* # Enables controlled consumption monitoring

### **1.3 Power Outage & Downtime Tracking**

# **What Is Tracked**

* # Time and duration of outages

* # Affected buildings or floors

* # Frequency of outages per period

# **How It Is Captured**

* # Manual incident reporting by facility staff

* # Automated uptime monitoring (where infrastructure allows)

# **System Outputs**

* # Downtime logs

* # Monthly outage frequency reports

* # Reliability trend analysis

# **Why This Matters**

* # Supports infrastructure improvement decisions

* # Helps justify power upgrades or redundancy

* # Creates an audit trail for service quality

### **1.4 Maintenance Request Management**

# **What Is Tracked**

* # Maintenance issues reported by staff or management

* # Issue category (electrical, plumbing, access, internet, structural)

* # Severity level

* # Time to resolution

# **How It Is Captured**

* # Central maintenance request form

* # Staff-submitted incident tickets

* # Automatic assignment workflow

# **System Outputs**

* # Open vs resolved tickets

* # Average resolution time

* # Repeated fault detection

# **Why This Matters**

* # Prevents issues from being ignored

* # Improves response efficiency

* # Creates accountability across maintenance teams

## **2\. Operational Dashboards (What Management Sees)**

### **2.1 Consumption Analytics Dashboard**

# **Displays:**

* # Electricity and gas usage by period

* # Cost impact summaries

* # Cross-building comparison

# **Enables:**

* # Cost control decisions

* # Performance benchmarking

* # Early detection of abnormal consumption

### **2.2 Predictive Usage & Forecasting**

# Uses historical data to:

* # Estimate future utility costs

* # Predict refill or recharge timelines

* # Support budget planning

# This allows management to move from reactive to predictive operations.

### **2.3 Fault Detection & Alerting**

# System highlights:

* # Repeated faults

* # Unresolved issues past SLA thresholds

* # High-risk operational areas

# Alerts can be:

* # Dashboard-based

* # Email-based (for management escalation)

### **2.4 Staff Accountability & Performance Tracking**

# **Tracks:**

* # Who logged an issue

* # Who was assigned

* # Time taken to resolve

* # Closure confirmation

# **Outputs:**

* # Staff performance metrics

* # Resolution timelines

* # Operational reliability scores

# This removes ambiguity and enforces responsibility.

## **3\. Implementation Approach**

### **Phase-Based Deployment**

# The FMS is deployed incrementally:

1. # Baseline Setup

   * # Dashboards

   * # Manual logging

   * # Incident tracking

2. # Smart Integration (Optional)

   * # Smart meters

   * # Gas sensors

   * # Automated ingestion

3. # Optimization

   * # Alerts

   * # Predictive analytics

   * # SLA enforcement

# This ensures deployment does not delay Spacer booking or access control rollout.

## **4\. Governance & Control**

* # Role-based access (Admin, Facility Manager, Technician)

* # Full activity audit logs

* # Historical data retention

* # Exportable reports for management review

## **5\. Goals of the FMS**

* # Reduce utility wastage

* # Improve response times

* # Enforce operational accountability

* # Enable data-driven decision-making

* # Professionalize hostel facility operations

* # Prepare KAY-WI for scalable, multi-property management

##

# **Alegre Farms Social Media Management & Digital Visibility Proposal**

**Prepared by Algolog Limited**  
**Date: November 2025**

# **1\. Executive Summary**

Alegre Farms remains one of the most unique and serene farm-resort destinations in Nigeria, offering an exceptional mix of nature, hospitality, and lifestyle experiences. However, its social media presence does not yet reflect the true beauty, depth, and commercial potential of the resort.

Our goal is simple:  
 Turn Alegre Farms into a top-of-mind resort brand with strong digital identity, consistent bookings, and unforgettable storytelling.

# Generic Modern Political Media and Technology

# **Proposal for a Modern Political Media and Technology Infrastructure**

### **For: Political Aspirant**

### **Prepared by: Algolog Limited**

*(Specialists in Digital Transformation, Media Engineering & Systems Design)*

## **Introduction: The Opportunity Before 2027**

We’ve heard about your intention to run for office **in 2027** — and as we conducted our background research, we noticed something remarkable:

A man of significant influence, accomplishment, and vision — yet when one searches for you online, there’s little or no centralized presence that reflects your stature.

The current digital footprint — a few scattered mentions and local reports — doesn’t capture **the scale of your experience, your leadership in business, or your contribution to Nigeria’s development**.

And in today’s world, **visibility is viability**.  
 Elections are no longer won by who speaks loudest — but by **who controls the narrative**, **who owns the data**, and **who commands the digital battlefield**.

We live in an age where **media and technology win elections**, shape perception, and create legacy.

That’s where we come in.

## **Our Vision: Building a Digital Legacy Around You**

We propose a full-scale **Media, Image, and Campaign Intelligence Platform** — an integrated system that combines **brand storytelling, digital media, and data infrastructure** to position you as **a leading voice for your state and Nigeria** ahead of 2027\.

This goes far beyond campaign publicity.  
 It’s about **engineering your influence** and making your message omnipresent — locally, nationally, and internationally.

# AI forcasting proposal for Supermarkets

# **AI-Powered Demand Forecasting for Supermarkets**

**Smart Inventory Planning for Nigerian Retailers**

## **The Problem**

Most supermarkets in Abuja still rely on guesswork or manual spreadsheets for inventory planning.  
 This leads to:

* Frequent stockouts of fast-moving products like Indomie, Peak Milk, and Dettol.  
* Overstocking of slow-moving or seasonal products that end up expiring on the shelf.  
* Missed sales opportunities during high-demand periods such as festive seasons, school resumptions, or promotions.  
* Inefficient cashflow — money tied up in dead stock while essentials are unavailable.

These challenges quietly eat into profit margins every month.

## **Our Solution**

Algolog introduces an AI-Powered Demand Forecasting System — a data-driven tool that predicts product demand accurately, week after week.

Using machine learning algorithms built on worldwide proven platforms, we train models that understand your supermarket’s unique sales patterns.

### **Key Features**

* Learn from historical sales data (3–6 months minimum).  
* Detects seasonality and recurring demand patterns.  
* Incorporates weather, holidays, and promotional events.  
* Generates weekly or monthly stock predictions per SKU.  
* Provides actionable restocking recommendations.

All insights are accessible via:

* A simple web dashboard  
* Automated email reports  
* Mobile alerts for quick decision-making

## **What You Get**

| Objective | Result |
| :---: | :---: |
| Reduce stockouts | Always have fast-moving items like Indomie, Peak Milk, or Milo in stock |
| Cut waste | Avoid overstocking perishable or low-turnover products |
| Increase profit margins | Match inventory levels to real demand |
| Smarter restocking | Free up cashflow and shelf space |
| Data-driven decisions | Know exactly when and what to reorder |

## **How It Works**

1. Data Collection – You provide 3–6 months of sales data (from POS, Excel, or CSV).  
2. Data Cleaning & Modeling – We prepare and feed your data into our AI model.  
3. Forecast Simulation – The model predicts demand for each SKU across time.  
4. Forecast Report – You receive a visual report showing predicted demand, reorder points, and product recommendations.  
5. Continuous Improvement (Optional) – We monitor accuracy monthly and retrain the model for improved results.

## **Pricing Options**

| Plan | Coverage | Deliverables | Pricing |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Pilot Package | 1–2 branches or up to 100 SKUs | One-time forecast report \+ recommendations | ₦350,000 |
| Standard Subscription | 3–5 branches or 500 SKUs | Monthly forecast updates \+ dashboard access | ₦600,000 per quarter |
| Enterprise Plan | Chain-wide integration with POS \+ continuous monitoring | Real-time forecasting \+ support | Custom Quote |

*All plans include training and onboarding support for your in-store or operations team.*

## **Example Impact**

Let’s say your supermarket sells Peak Milk, Dettol, and Indomie:

* The AI detects that Indomie sales double every payday weekend.  
* It learns that Peak Milk demand spikes in December and during Ramadan.  
* It finds that Dettol sales drop when new antiseptic brands are promoted nearby.

Instead of reacting late, you plan ahead — stocking the right quantities before demand hits.  
 That’s more sales, fewer lost customers, and less expired stock.

## **Why Algolog**

Algolog specializes in AI-driven business optimization tools for African enterprises.  
 Our systems combine global-standard technology with local retail realities — delivering practical, measurable value to your business.

We’ve helped businesses modernize operations using:

* Data automation  
* AI forecasting  
* Smart space and facility management tools like Spacer  
* Business analytics and workflow automation

## **Next Steps**

We invite your supermarket to join our AI Forecasting Pilot Program.

To get started:

1. Share 3–6 months of sales data (CSV, Excel, or POS export).  
2. We deliver a sample forecast and walk you through insights.  
3. Decide on your preferred plan after the pilot.

 \- Bank account details for Paystack setup and tax/compliance documentation.  
 \- Training for frontline staff on order fulfillment and using the admin dashboard.

## **10\. Risks & Mitigation**

\- Operational capacity (mitigation: phased rollout by store/location and limited delivery zones initially).  
 \- Stock inconsistencies (mitigation: daily sync, low-stock alerts, manual reconciliation process).  
 \- Payment disputes (mitigation: clear refund policy, digital receipts, and support flow).  
 \- Delivery delays (mitigation: realistic SLA, buffer windows, and live tracking).

## **11\. Next Steps**

1\. Confirm interest.  
 2\. Schedule a 60–90 minute discovery session (we will finalise scope and capture product data).  
 3\. Sign an engagement letter / proposal and initial deposit invoice (50%) to commence work.  
 4\. Project kick-off and weekly sprint updates until launch.

# Proposal for Citystake HMIS Implementation

![][image1]

Proposal for Citystake HMIS Implementation

Prepared by: Algolog Limited

Prepared for: Citystake Apartments

Date: 23rd September, 2025

---

## 1\. Introduction

Citystake Apartments has expressed the need for a Hotel & Apartment Management Information System (HMIS) to streamline operations, improve guest experience, and enhance management visibility. Currently, many apartments in Kaduna rely on manual processes for check-ins, bookings, and invoicing, which leads to inefficiencies and errors.

Our proposed HMIS will integrate room booking, guest management, invoicing, kitchen orders, and door security access into one seamless system, while also automating key workflows using industry-standard tools.

---

## 2\. Solution Overview

The HMIS will combine several tools into one operational system:

* Spacer → To manage apartment availability, bookings, and renewals.  
* Google Workspace → For internal communication, document sharing, and staff coordination.  
* Airtable → To store guest data, manage check-ins/check-outs, and track invoices.  
* Zapier → To automate workflows between Spacer, Airtable, Google Workspace, and WhatsApp.  
* WhatsApp Automation → Guests receive booking confirmations and door access codes directly.  
* RFID Door Locks → Each of the 12 apartments will have a lock system linked to check-in.

Guest Experience Flow:

1. Guests book an apartment online or at reception.  
2. Reception confirms booking → Spacer marks the unit as occupied.  
3. Guest checks in by filling out a digital form → Details stored in Airtable.  
4. A unique keycode is generated automatically and sent to guests via WhatsApp.  
5. Guests use the keycode on the RFID lock for access.  
6. Kitchen orders and invoices are processed via Airtable, with receipts sent digitally.  
7. At checkout, staff updates Airtable → Room status resets to “Available”.

---

## 3\. Step-by-Step Setup Plan

### Phase 1: RFID Lock Installation

* Install 12 RFID smart locks (one per apartment).  
* Configure locks to accept auto-generated codes.  
* Integrate lock system with guest check-in workflows.  
* Test end-to-end process from booking → check-in → check-out

### Phase 2: Spacer Integration

* Configure all 12 apartments as bookable units in Spacer.  
* Define pricing tiers (daily, weekly, monthly).  
* Connect Spacer with Airtable for real-time availability updates.

### Phase 3: Airtable Database Setup

* Create a guest check-in/check-out database.  
* Add kitchen orders \+ invoicing tables.  
* Build reporting dashboards for management.

### Phase 4: Zapier Automations

* Automate sync between Spacer and Airtable.  
* Automate invoice generation \+ delivery.  
* Automate unique keycode generation \+ send to WhatsApp.

### Phase 5: Google Workspace Setup

* Provision accounts for staff (Admin, Reception, Kitchen, Manager).  
* Create group emails and shared calendars.  
* Enable cloud storage for guest files and reports.

### Phase 6: Training & Deployment

* Train reception, kitchen, and management staff.  
* Provide documentation \+ support for the first 3 months.

# Saadatu’s Apartment HMIS

![][image1]

Proposal for Saadatu’s Apartment HMIS Implementation

Prepared by: Algolog Limited

Prepared for: Saadatu’s Apartment Kaduna

Date: 1st October, 2025

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Saadatu’s Apartment has an opportunity to transform how it manages bookings, check-ins, payments, and daily operations. At the moment, most apartments in Kaduna still run on semi-manual processes — phone calls, WhatsApp bookings, paper receipts, and long check-in times.

Algolog proposes to set up a modern **Hospitality Management Information System (HMIS)** built on **Spacer** (for online bookings and payments) and **Airtable** (for property management, invoicing, and dashboards). The system will also use **Zapier** to connect the tools and automate tasks like generating digital access codes and sending them to guests via WhatsApp.

The total cost for this complete system is **₦2,000,000 (two million naira only)**. This investment will give Saadatu’s Apartment a professional system that improves guest experience, increases occupancy, reduces errors, and boosts profitability.

## **2\. Why This Matters for Saadatu’s Apartment**

### **Current Challenges (in apartments)**

* Bookings often get lost between WhatsApp, calls, and in-person visits  
* Manual check-in wastes time and reduces guest satisfaction  
* Owners and managers don’t have a clear picture of occupancy and revenue  
* Kitchen or side sales (food, drinks, laundry) are not well tracked  
* Staff time is wasted on things that could be automated

### **Opportunities with Algolog HMIS**

* **More revenue:** online bookings \+ guaranteed payments before arrival reduce no-shows  
* **Better guest experience:** fast, automated check-in and secure access codes  
* **Clear reporting:** owners see live occupancy, sales, and profit on a dashboard  
* **Lower staff stress:** less manual recording, fewer mistakes  
* **Competitive edge:** stand out against other apartments that still use manual processes

## **3\. How the System Will Work (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Booking Online (Spacer)**  
   * Guests visit Saadatu’s Apartment’s booking page on Spacer  
   * They select dates, see availability, and pay directly online  
   * Payment is confirmed immediately  
2. **Automatic Record (Airtable)**  
   * Once payment is confirmed, the system automatically creates a booking record in Airtable with:  
     * Guest’s name  
     * Phone number  
     * Room booked  
     * Amount paid  
     * Dates of stay  
3. **Check-in Process (Reception Desk)**  
   * When the guest arrives, the receptionist switches the booking status to “Checked In” on Airtable  
4. **Check-out Process**  
   * When the guest checks out, the receptionist changes the status to “Checked Out” in Airtable.  
5. **Kitchen & Other Sales (Invoices)**  
   * If the guest orders food, laundry, or other services, staff can record it in Airtable  
   * An invoice is created automatically and linked to that guest’s stay  
   * Management sees all kitchen sales alongside room bookings  
6. **Management Dashboard**  
   * Airtable dashboard shows:  
     * Occupancy (rooms available vs. booked)  
     * Total booking revenue  
     * Kitchen/extra sales  
     * Top-selling items from the kitchen  
     * Daily, weekly, and monthly revenue reports  
   * Owners and managers can log in anytime to see real-time numbers

## **4\. Financial Impact (Simple ROI Explanation)**

* With this system, guests can book directly online — reducing reliance on agents or booking sites that take commissions.  
* Guests who get smooth service are more likely to return and recommend to friends.  
* Faster check-ins mean staff can serve more guests with less stress.  
* Kitchen and other services get fully tracked, no missing revenue.

**Example Impact:**

* If Saadatu’s Apartment adds just 5 extra bookings a month through online visibility, at ₦40,000 per booking, that’s ₦200,000 extra monthly revenue (₦2.4M per year).  
* With clear tracking and reduced errors, lost revenue from unrecorded sales will also be recovered.

This means the system could pay for itself in the first year.

# **Proposal for Spacer Implementation at A Class Park & Events, Abuja**

**Prepared for:** A Class Park & Events  
 **Prepared by:** Algolog Limited  
 **Date:** 3rd October 2025

## **Executive Summary**

A Class Park Abuja, with its 3 event marquees and multiple event spaces, represents a premier destination for events in the city. As guest expectations evolve, efficient booking management, smooth event scheduling, and real-time operational oversight have become essential for maximizing revenue and ensuring a superior customer experience.

Algolog Limited proposes deploying **Spacer**, our flagship booking and management solution, to streamline how A Class Park manages event bookings, check-ins, payments, and operational oversight.

# KA\_WI Limited HMIS Proposal.

![][image1]

## **Proposal for KA\_WI Limited – Smart HMIS & Automation Deployment**

**Prepared by:** Algolog Limited  
 **Prepared for:** KA\_WI Limited, Abuja  
 **Date:** 21st October, 2025

---

### **1\. Executive Summary**

KA\_WI Limited manages several modern serviced apartments in Abuja and seeks to improve efficiency, guest satisfaction, and management visibility. Currently, most apartment operations — such as bookings, payments, and check-ins — still rely on manual coordination, which often leads to errors, lost records, and slower guest service.

Algolog proposes deploying a **Hospitality Management Information System (HMIS)** powered by **Spacer** to automate KA\_WI’s apartment operations. The solution will combine:

* **Online bookings and payments** (via Spacer and Paystack)  
* **Automated Smart Lock system** for keyless access  
* **Virtual Spaces** for flexible rental options (e.g., subleasing parts of an apartment)  
* **Real-time dashboards** for performance and occupancy monitoring

This system will help KA\_WI reduce manual tasks, improve occupancy tracking, and deliver a more professional and secure guest experience.

### **2\. Why This Matters for KA\_WI Limited**

#### **Current Challenges**

* Manual booking and check-in processes delay guest experience  
* Limited flexibility in renting apartments by sections (e.g., partial bookings)  
* No centralized view for management to monitor bookings and revenue  
* Security concerns with physical keys and manual access control

#### **Opportunities with Algolog HMIS**

* Guests can book directly online — no manual WhatsApp or phone coordination  
* Payment is automated via **Paystack** (card or transfer)  
* Receptionists generate and manage access codes easily at check-in  
* Management gains complete visibility through dashboards  
* **Virtual spaces** create flexible rental options that increase occupancy and profits

### **3\. How the System Works (Step-by-Step)**

#### **Booking Flow**

* Each apartment is listed individually on the **Spacer Gallery View**  
* Guests browse available apartments, view photos, amenities, and pricing  
* They select the desired apartment (or virtual sub-apartment) and choose their stay dates  
* The system displays pricing and collects payment through **Paystack** (card or transfer)  
* Once payment is confirmed, booking details are recorded and visible to staff

#### **Virtual Spaces**

* Virtual spaces allow **multi-tier bookings** under a single apartment listing.

  * For example, *Apartment 11* (3-bedroom) can have:

    * *Apartment 11 – 2 Bedrooms*

    * *Apartment 11 – 1 Bedroom*

* These subspaces are linked to the main apartment but treated as unique spaces for booking and pricing.  
* The system automatically checks for **conflicts**, ensuring no overlapping bookings between full and partial rentals.  
* This feature allows KA-WI to **maximize space utilization** and cater to various customer budgets.

#### **Smart Lock Automation**

* When a guest arrives, the **receptionist logs into Spacer** and views all pending bookings.  
* After verifying payment and confirming the booking details, the receptionist clicks **“Check-In.”**  
* At that moment:  
  * A **unique smart lock code** is generated automatically via the **SmartLife API**  
  * The code is valid only for the booking duration  
  * The guest receives the access code via email  
* At checkout, when the receptionist clicks **“Check-Out,”** the code automatically **expires** and is deactivated.

*(This process ensures both security and controlled access — guests only have access during their active booking period.)*

#### **Invoicing & Payment Flow**

* For walk-in guests, receptionists create bookings manually in Spacer.  
* Payments can be processed by:  
  * **Card** – directly on the Paystack gateway  
  * **Bank Transfer** – using the generated temporary account number (valid for 30 minutes)  
* Once payment is received, the booking is locked in automatically, and the space is marked as unavailable.  
* Extra services (laundry, meals, cleaning) can also be invoiced within the system, ensuring proper revenue tracking.

#### **Management Dashboard**

The management dashboard provides real-time visibility, showing:

* Bookings (Pending, Checked-In, Checked-Out)  
* Occupancy rate and apartment availability  
* Revenue performance (bookings \+ extra services)  
* Virtual space utilization and conflict tracking  
* Smart lock logs (who checked in, when codes were generated, expiration times)

# Focal Point Drycleaners Traceability Proposal.

![][image1]

# **Proposal to Focal Point Drycleaners**

**To:** The Management Team, Focal Point Drycleaners  
 **From:** Algolog Limited  
 **Date:** October 21, 2025  
 **Subject:** Rapid-Deployment Garment Traceability Solution for Operational Stability

## **1\. Overview**

This proposal presents a **fast, focused, and durable solution** to eliminate garment loss and restore operational control at Focal Point Drycleaners.

We propose a **Garment Traceability System (“Tracer”)** — a lightweight, easily deployable module built around **QR-coded (or barcoded) heat seal labels** and a **simple tablet-based app**.

This solution directly targets your core issue: tracking garments reliably throughout their lifecycle — from check-in to packaging — without disrupting your existing workflow.

It is designed as an immediate, **stabilization measure**, providing rapid relief and forming a foundation for future process digitalization.

## **2\. Understanding Your Current Challenge**

Your operation is constrained by the daily breakdown of traceability caused by fragile paper tags and manual record-keeping. This creates:

* **Frequent garment loss:** Items lose identification after cleaning or pressing due to detached paper tags.  
* **Time wastage:** Staff spend excessive time searching for missing items to complete an order.  
* **Customer dissatisfaction:** Late or lost deliveries erode customer trust and brand reputation.  
* **Inefficient reporting:** Without accurate tracking data, it’s difficult to identify where process bottlenecks occur.

This single pain point cascades into lost revenue, staff burnout, and declining customer confidence.

## **3\. The Proposed Solution – “Tracer”**

Our **Tracer Module** is a compact, technology-assisted traceability system designed to **solve this exact issue immediately**. It consists of three integrated components:

### **a. Durable QR-Coded Heat Seals**

* Permanent, washable labels that replace paper tags.  
* Each label carries a **unique QR or barcode**, acting as a **digital fingerprint** for the garment.  
* Can withstand washing, pressing, and chemical treatment.

### **b. The “Tracer” Tablet App**

A lightweight, intuitive app designed specifically for factory use, supporting three main functions:

1. **Check-In** – Staff link garments to customer orders by scanning or printing their unique QR tag.  
    Returning garments can be re-linked instantly with a single scan.  
2. **Station Scan** – Each workstation (washing, pressing, folding, etc.) uses a quick 2-second scan to update the garment’s real-time status and location.  
3. **Assembly & Packaging** – When it’s time to deliver, staff can scan **any one item** from an order to immediately locate all related garments.

This eliminates confusion, prevents misplacement, and ensures every order is complete before dispatch.

### **c. Hardware Kit**

To ensure smooth deployment, our setup will include:

* A **QR label printer**  
* A **heat press** for applying seals  
* **Factory-use tablets** with preloaded Tracer software

## **4\. How It Fits into Your Existing Workflow**

The system has been carefully designed to **fit seamlessly** into your current operation without disruption.

| Stage | Current Workflow | With Tracer System |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Check-In** | Paper tag attached to garment | QR-coded heat seal attached; order created digitally |
| **Processing** | Garments move without digital tracking | Scanned at each station, location updated automatically |
| **Assembly** | Manual matching of garments | System automatically identifies missing items |
| **Packaging/Dispatch** | Staff manually confirm orders | Digital checklist confirms complete order instantly |

The system **augments your staff’s workflow**, providing visibility and accountability at every step.

## 

## **5\. Project Timeline (Estimated 4 Weeks)**

| Week | Activity |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Week 1** | Requirements finalization, hardware procurement, and system setup |
| **Week 2** | Application configuration and internal testing |
| **Week 3** | On-site hardware installation and hands-on training for staff |
| **Week 4** | Go-live and on-site support for smooth transition |

## **6\. Implementation Requirements**

The system depends on the successful procurement and setup of the following hardware:

* Heat press machine for applying the durable QR seals  
* QR label printer(Heat seal based)  
* Factory tablets (One unit per station)  
* Local network (Wi-Fi) connection for data syncing

Once these are in place, the Tracer module can be deployed and tested within **four weeks**.

## **7\. Expected Impact**

| Category | Result |
| :---: | :---: |
| **Garment Traceability** | 100% traceable process from check-in to dispatch |
| **Lost Garments** | Reduced to near zero |
| **Order Completion Time** | Reduced by up to 40% |
| **Staff Efficiency** | Increased by automating tracking |
| **Customer Experience** | Improved reliability and faster delivery turnaround |

This solution stabilizes your operation and builds a foundation for full factory digitalization in the future — including customer tracking, payment systems, and performance dashboards.

## **8\. Next Steps**

1. Review this proposal internally.  
2. Confirm your readiness to procure the required hardware.  
3. Schedule a discovery session with our team to align technical specifications and deployment timeline.

Upon your approval, our development team will proceed to configure and deploy the Tracer module, ensuring your garment flow becomes **completely traceable, efficient, and stress-free**.

# Saadatu’s Apartment — System Update

![][image1]

# **Saadatu’s Apartment — System Update**

**Prepared by:** Algolog Limited  
 **Date:** 23rd October, 2025

## **1\. Objective**

This document details the second-phase feature updates to the *Saadatu’s Apartment HMIS*, built on the **Spacer platform**.  
These updates introduce new modules designed to extend the system’s flexibility, booking logic, and administrative oversight.  
Each component adds unique layers of customization to Spacer’s core framework — requiring new logic, validation rules, and coordination between client- and admin-facing systems.

## **2\. Update Scope and Expected Deliverables**

### **Feature Group 1: Unified Gallery View (Single Listing Enhancement)**

**Description:**  
Implement a unified display logic that presents each apartment type as a **single listing** on the gallery view, while the system automatically manages internal unit distribution.

**Outline:**

* Modify front-end logic to consolidate multiple identical units into one parent listing (e.g., all 3-bedroom apartments appear as one item).  
* Implement intelligent assignment logic: when a booking is made, the system automatically attaches the guest to an available physical apartment.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Cleaner booking interface.  
* Simplified backend space management.  
* More intuitive presentation for guests.

### **Feature Group 2: Virtual Spaces System**

**Description:**  
 Enable creation of **virtual subspaces** under a main apartment unit to allow bookings for smaller configurations — for instance:

* Apartment 11 → Apartment 11 (2 Rooms) → Apartment 11 (1 Room)

These virtual spaces inherit their data from the parent apartment but operate as independent booking units for availability and pricing.

**Outline:**

* Virtual space creation and linking system within admin panel.  
* Shared metadata (capacity, pricing structure, amenities) inherited from the parent space.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Flexible pricing tiers.  
* Smarter occupancy utilization.  
* No booking conflicts between subspaces and parent units.

### **Feature Group 3: Admin Approval Workflow for Subspace Bookings**

**Description:**  
 Create a distinct **approval and oversight flow** for bookings under virtual spaces (1-room or 2-room configurations) to ensure controlled allocation.

**Technical Outline:**

* Add a **“Manager Approval Required”** status for all subspace booking requests.  
* Notify system admin or property manager when a new subspace booking is made.  
* Admin can approve, decline, or reassign subspace bookings before confirmation.  
* Automatic fallback to pending status until decision is logged.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Centralized oversight for sub-bookings.  
* Added administrative transparency for staff decisions.

## **3\. Deployment & Testing**

* **Development & Integration:** 2 weeks  
* **Testing & QA:** 2 week (covering all approval and assignment edge cases)  
* **On-Site Validation:** 1 day (staff test and feedback)

**Total Duration:** 4 weeks post-approval.

## **4\. Notes on Costing**

These are **custom feature extensions** to Spacer, not baseline setup work.  
 Pricing reflects **new feature development**, **backend integration**, and **testing complexity**.

# Proposal for Yanna Apartments

![][image1]

# **Proposal for Yanna Apartments**

### **Presented by: Algolog Limited**

**Date:** October 2025

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Yanna Apartments currently runs on a global platform, but one that’s limited in local support, custom automation, and cost efficiency.

Your guests must be redirected to an external booking site to check availability or make reservations, and your staff must manually program door cards for every check-in. Both of these introduce unnecessary delay, cost, and complexity to your guest experience.  
 We propose migrating to **Spacer**, a next-generation **hospitality automation system** developed for **Nigerian operators** who want full control over their spaces, payments, and smart devices — without dependency on foreign systems.

Our solution keeps everything your team is used to — online booking, guest management, and analytics — but **adds automated door access**, **local control**, and **real-time support** from a Nigerian team that understands your context.

## 

## 

## **2\. The Pain (Current Situation)**

You already have a booking platform, but:

**Manual Door Programming Wastes Hundreds of Hours**

* Your staff currently spend an average of **8–10 minutes per guest** programming access cards, verifying identities, and resetting doors at checkout.  
* With approximately **400 check-ins per month**, that’s **over 60 staff hours weekly** — nearly **200 hours per month** — spent on repetitive, low-value work.  
* This translates to the equivalent of **₦450,000–₦500,000/month** in lost productivity (or extra salary cost) — just to do something that Spacer automates with **one click**.

  **Broken Booking Flow \= Lost Sales**

* Your website currently redirects users to an **external foreign booking portal** for availability checks.  
* Guests drop off when redirected — especially mobile users.  
* On average, hotels and apartments lose **25–40%** of potential online conversions from such redirects.  
* Every 10 lost bookings per month at ₦40,000 each equals **₦400,000 in potential monthly losses**.

  **Foreign Dependency & Lack of Customization**

* You rely on foreign software providers for updates, bug fixes, and support.  
* Custom features or quick adjustments (e.g. door access integration, payment flexibility) take weeks or months to implement.  
* Spacer gives you **full local control** and **fast response**— compliant with local data standards.


This isn’t just inconvenient — it’s expensive, and it slows your operations.

## **3\. The Spacer Advantage (Our Offer)**

Spacer gives Yanna Apartments everything your current system does — and more — in a **single, connected suite** that you control. Spacer isn’t just a replacement for your current system — it’s a smarter, more localized evolution built around automation and direct ownership.

### **A. Smart Door Lock Automation**

Spacer integrates directly with **locks**, automating every step from check-in to check-out:

* When a booking is confirmed, **Spacer instantly generates a digital access code**.  
* The code is sent to the guest’s email address.  
* The code **expires** at checkout — no need for staff to revoke access manually.  
* All access logs are visible to management in real-time.

This means **zero manual keycard provisioning**, **zero mix-ups**, and **100% guest convenience**.

Your property becomes fully self-running — guests can arrive, access, and check out seamlessly.

### **B. Unified Booking & Payment System**

Spacer offers all the features of your existing cloud system — but made for Nigeria:

* **Bookings**: Guests can view your apartments on a clean gallery view and book instantly.  
* **Payments**: Integrated with **Paystack** for instant verification.  
* **Offline Support**: Staff can still check in walk-in guests when the network fluctuates.  
* **Receipts & Invoices**: Auto-generated and synced for each transaction.

### **C. Management Dashboard**

The Spacer dashboard gives your team control and insight at a glance:

* Occupancy overview — what’s booked, what’s free  
* Revenue breakdown — daily, weekly, monthly  
* Staff activity monitoring  
* Notification center for key actions (new booking, check-in, expired code)

### **D. Local Support & Customization**

Unlike global platforms, Spacer is **built and managed locally** by **Algolog Limited**.  
 That means:

* 24/7 access to our engineering and support team  
* On-site setup and staff training in Abuja  
* Custom feature requests implemented faster  
* No recurring foreign subscription fees. You get to use Spacer FREE forever.

## **4\. Financial Impact Summary**

| Area | Current State | Spacer Impact | Monthly Savings |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Door Access Provisioning | 200+ hours/month manual labor | Automated check-in/out | ₦150,000 – ₦250,000 |

| Card Management & Replacement | Recurring hardware costs | Digital access codes | ₦50,000+ |
| Support & Subscription | Foreign SaaS dependency | Local one-time deployment | ₦100,000+ |

**Total Potential Recovery:** ₦700,000+ monthly value saved or gained

Spacer pays for itself in **less than three months**.

## **5\. Why Switch Now**

Every delay keeps your staff locked in manual routines and your guests waiting.  
 Spacer is **ready-to-deploy**, built to **match your current operations**, and can be **live in 7 days**.

By switching, Yanna Apartments will:

*  Automate guest access instantly  
* Eliminate manual card provisioning  
*  Gain local tech support and faster updates  
*  Reduce costs — no foreign subscription

# Proposal for Spacer

**![][image1]**

## **Spacer Proposal**

Proposal: Hospitality Automation System Deployment  
 Prepared by: Algolog Limited  
 Date: October 2025

### **1\. Your Pain (Current Situation)**

Most hotels today still rely on manual or semi-digital systems that create daily bottlenecks:

* Staff manually assign key cards for every guest.  
* Bookings happen across WhatsApp, calls, and walk-ins — causing confusion and double-booking.  
* Payments get delayed or mixed up between departments.  
* Management lacks real-time insight into occupancy or revenue.

These small inefficiencies add up — lost time, lost revenue, and frustrated guests.

### **2\. Your Risk of Doing Nothing**

Every day this system continues, staff work harder for less efficiency.  
Errors stay hidden, and guests experience delays at check-in — something no premium space should allow.

Meanwhile, your competitors are moving toward smart automation and getting five-star reviews for speed, convenience, and reliability.

Doing nothing now means losing market position later.

### **3\. Our Offer to You: What Spacer Does Differently**

Spacer is a smart hospitality management system that completely automates your booking, payments, and access control.

It’s a single platform that replaces spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, and manual locks — giving your hotel a modern, tech-powered experience.

#### **A. Automated Door Access**

* Spacer connects directly with your smart locks.  
* Once a booking is confirmed, the system generates a digital keycode for the guest.  
* The keycode is sent automatically via email.  
* When the guest checks out, the key automatically expires.  
* No manual intervention, no keycards, no waiting.

#### **B. Booking & Payment Flow**

* Guests can book directly online or walk-in guests can be logged from the reception dashboard.  
* Payments are handled securely via Paystack (or card/transfer option).  
* The system automatically confirms bookings and prevents double-booking conflicts.  
* Receipts and invoices are generated instantly.

#### **C. Management Dashboard**

* View live data on occupancy, revenue, and guest activity.  
* Get automated notifications for all actions.  
* Filter analytics by day, week, or month.

#### **D. Staff Control**

* Role-based access for receptionists, managers, and admin.  
* Reduce dependency on manual oversight.

### **4\. Why Spacer is Different**

Unlike global tools that charge in USD and offer little support, Spacer is designed, built, and supported locally by Algolog.

That means:

* *Full local support in Nigeria.*  
* *One-time setup cost — no foreign subscription fees.*  
* *Customizations to fit your property’s exact workflow.*  
* *Integration with Nigerian payment gateways and internet setups.*

### **5\. Implementation Plan (Fast Rollout)**

| Phase | Task | Duration |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | Smart lock and system setup | 2 days |
| 2 | Booking & payment integration | 2 days |
| 3 | Staff onboarding and training | 1 day |
| Total Duration | 5 Days to Go-Live |  |

We’ll test the flow end-to-end — from booking to check-out — and provide your staff with complete guidance on how to manage bookings confidently.

### **6\. Results You Can Expect**

* Guests check in within seconds, no manual keys.  
* Managers have real-time control of occupancy and payments.  
* Staff spend less time managing chaos, more time serving guests.  
* Your hotel immediately looks modern, secure, and well-run.

### **7\. Next Steps**

1. Approve this proposal.  
2. We’ll inspect your current lock system and confirm integration.  
3. Start setup and training immediately.

### **8\. Why Algolog?**

Algolog is your high-tech partner dedicated to driving measurable growth through intelligent digital systems. We combine business intelligence, custom-built software, and AI-driven automation to streamline your workflows and elevate performance.

With proven success delivering integrated solutions for the hospitality and co-working sectors, our team ensures every system is designed for efficiency and long-term scalability.

You don’t just get software — you get a committed technology partner who’s always available for on-site and virtual support, focused on real business outcomes, not just project delivery.

# **Proposal for a Modern Political Media and Technology Infrastructure**

### **For: Hon. Kashim Musa Tumsah**

### **Prepared by: Algolog Limited**

*(Specialists in Digital Transformation, Media Engineering & Systems Design)*

## **Introduction: The Opportunity Before 2027**

We’ve heard about your intention to run for office in **Yobe State in 2027** — and as we conducted our background research, we noticed something remarkable:

A man of significant influence, accomplishment, and vision — yet when one searches for you online, there’s little or no centralized presence that reflects your stature.

The current digital footprint — a few scattered mentions and local reports — doesn’t capture **the scale of your experience, your leadership in business, or your contribution to Nigeria’s development**.

And in today’s world, **visibility is viability**.  
 Elections are no longer won by who speaks loudest — but by **who controls the narrative**, **who owns the data**, and **who commands the digital battlefield**.

We live in an age where **media and technology win elections**, shape perception, and create legacy.

That’s where we come in.

## **Our Vision: Building a Digital Legacy Around Kashim Musa Tumsah**

We propose a full-scale **Media, Image, and Campaign Intelligence Platform** — an integrated system that combines **brand storytelling, digital media, and data infrastructure** to position you as **a leading voice for Yobe and Nigeria** ahead of 2027\.

This goes far beyond campaign publicity.  
 It’s about **engineering your influence** and making your message omnipresent — locally, nationally, and internationally.

* A **documentary-style short film** that tells your story — your journey, business legacy, and service to Yobe and Nigeria.  
* International media outreach and syndication through **Internationally recognized outlets**.  
* A **digital press kit** for journalists, partners, and campaign teams.

*We make sure people don’t just hear your name — they see your work, they feel your presence, and they trust your message.*

  * Predictive models to identify strongholds and weak zones.  
  * Visual maps of voter engagement across LGAs and wards.

*This is not a campaign — it’s a controlled operation. Data, logistics, and communication working as one unit.*

### **4\. Media Production & Documentation**

**Goal:** Establish emotional connection through storytelling.

We’d be honored to bring this vision to life.

## **Why Algolog**

At **Algolog**, we represent a new generation of innovators — young, creative, and all-round Nigerians, relentlessly driven by the belief that technology and storytelling can redefine leadership in Africa.

You already know us through our work with Alegre Farms and Resort, where we partnered with your team to deliver a complete digital transformation across both technology and brand experience.  Through Spacer (Algolog’s flagship space and hospitality management tool trusted by space operators across Africa, from hotels to service apartments and resorts to co-working hubs), we rebuilt the entire booking flow into a seamless, modern system—introducing smarter space management, automated payments,space bookings, and an elegant gallery inspired by premium resort designs. Alongside this, we designed the Alegre Farms and Resort website into a clean, high-converting platform that showcased the resort’s identity while making bookings easier and more intuitive than ever.

To elevate visibility and strengthen the brand story, we produced a full media campaign: professional photography, drone footage, lifestyle video scenes, and a cinematic social media advert that followed a guest’s journey through the farm. This combined creative and technical overhaul did more than improve operations— it strengthened Alegre’s online presence, boosted trust, and positioned the resort as a standout destination in its category.

 Through that collaboration, we saw firsthand your **commitment to excellence, vision for growth, and belief in innovation**.  
 That same spirit is what inspires this new journey — to translate your achievements, values, and leadership story into a compelling digital and political narrative that resonates across Yobe, Nigeria, and beyond.

We don’t approach this campaign as just another media or software project.  
 We see it as **a partnership to build the digital architecture of your legacy** — one that mirrors your business acumen and commitment to community development.

Our team combines:

* **Strategic thinkers** who understand the pulse of public perception,  
* **Engineers and data experts** who build systems that run with precision, and  
* **Creative storytellers** who know how to make leadership felt and remembered.

We are not outsiders looking in — we are the **next generation of Nigerian innovators**, bringing fresh, intelligent energy into your campaign.  
 Our focus is to merge **youthful creativity with professional excellence**, crafting a media and technology framework that positions you as the modern, forward-thinking leader Yobe deserves.

*With Algolog, your story will not only be told — it will be felt.*  
 *Your campaign will not just compete — it will **lead**.*  
 *And together, we’ll create a digital legacy that inspires the next generation.*

# Focal Point Operational Digitization

**![][image1]**

# **Focal Point Operational Digitization & Tracking System Proposal**

**Prepared by Algolog Limited**  
 **Date: November 2025**

# **1\. Executive Summary**

Focal Point has demonstrated exceptional growth and consistency in the laundry and garment-care industry. However, your operations now require a unified digital system that strengthens accountability, eliminates financial leakages, simplifies tracking, enhances customer experience, and supports scalable growth.

After a full review of your current workflow and an in-depth conversation with your leadership team, Algolog proposes the development of a fully integrated Operational, Tracking & Revenue Assurance System built precisely around how Focal Point works.

This system is designed to replace DriveStream with a stronger, more secure, more accurate platform that manages your entire operation end to end — from customer intake to final delivery, staff productivity, returns management, financial reconciliation, and real-time tracking.

Our mission is to help Focal Point operate with the precision of a fully automated enterprise while giving management complete visibility and control across all locations.

# **2\. Project Vision**

To deliver a world-class operational backbone that:

* Eliminates losses and human error  
* Automates customer tracking  
* Strengthens revenue assurance  
* Monitors staff performance  
* Detects operational fraud early  
* Simplifies payments and invoicing

# Focal Point Final Packaging Solution

![][image1]

# **Focal Point Updated Solution: Order-Level Final Scan**

Since QR codes are attached to individual clothes and cannot be scanned once items are inside sealed packages, the workflow should shift to an order-level confirmation process instead of post-packaging scanning.

Below is the corrected workflow.

# **1\. Clothes-Level Scanning Ends Before Packaging**

Each clothing item is scanned individually during intake, washing, drying, ironing and quality check.  
 By the time clothes reach the packing stage, the system already has a complete digital list of items belonging to the customer’s order.

# **2\. Final Packing Checklist**

**At the packing stage:**

* The system generates a digital checklist of all items belonging to the order.  
* Staff verify the presence and condition of each item physically.  
* Staff mark the order as “Packed & Verified” inside the system.

**This prevents the need for scanning items after they are inside the package.**

# **3\. Order-Level QR Code**

**Once “Packed & Verified” is completed:**

* The system generates a single Order QR Code.  
* This code is printed on the package.  
* This code is not tied to individual clothes, so it can be scanned after packaging.

# **4\. Final Handover Using the Order QR Code**

**At pickup or dispatch:**

* Staff or rider scans the Order QR Code.  
* The system moves the order to “Out for Delivery” or “Ready for Pickup.”  
* The handover is timestamped and logged.

# **Benefits of This Approach**

* Clothes do not need to be scanned after packaging.  
* Tracking accuracy is maintained through the workflow.  
* Packaging, handover and delivery are fully traceable.  
* Customers can confirm receipt without exposing or reopening the package.  
* The entire process remains auditable.

# Focal Point Proposal

![][image1]

**Proposal for Focal Point**

**Operational System Replacement**

**Prepared by: Algolog Limited**

**Contact:**

**Yasmin Umar  — Chief Brand Strategist**

**yasmin@algolog.co**

**\+234 706 905 7925**

**Date: November 2025**

**1\. What We Discussed**

Based on our conversations, the core issues are:

* Items occasionally leave without confirmed payment — and you only find out later  
* Staff productivity is hard to measure accurately  
* Returns eat into margins without clear accountability  
* DriveStream doesn't give you the visibility you need  
* As you expand, these problems will scale with you  
* You need a system that tracks everything, blocks what shouldn't happen, and shows you what's going on in real time.

**2\. What the System Does**

The short version: every item is tracked from intake to delivery, every action is logged, and nothing leaves without payment confirmed.

| Current State | With New System |
| :---- | :---- |
| Items can leave without payment (discovered later) | System blocks release until payment confirmed |
| Staff productivity estimated manually | Exact count per person via scan |
| Returns happen without clear accountability | Full trail: who handled it, when, why |
| Reconciliation is manual and error-prone | Automatic, real-time |
| Customer tracking is fragmented | Single view from intake to delivery |
| Management visibility is partial and delayed | Complete and live |

	

	

**3\. What's Included**

To deliver this, the system covers:

* Customer intake and tracking  
* Item lifecycle (every garment, every step)  
* Staff productivity measurement (scan-based)  
* Payment confirmation before release  
* Returns and penalty management  
* Reconciliation and reporting  
* Customer portal and website  
* SOP documentation

Also included:

* Data migration from DriveStream  
* Staff training  
* 24 months technical support

**4\. Investment**

₦20,000,000 (one-time)

| System investment | ₦20,000,000 |
| :---- | :---- |

	

That's the conservative view — just counting what you stop losing.

If you license this to even 5 other dry cleaners at ₦2-5M each, the system pays for itself immediately — and becomes a revenue stream.

**6\. Timeline**	

| Phase | Duration |
| :---- | :---- |
| Requirements & data mapping | 1 week |
| Architecture & UX | 2 weeks |
| Core development | 3 months |
| Customer portal & website | 1-2 weeks |
| Testing | 2 weeks |
| Migration & go-live | 3-5 days |
| Training | 1 day |

	

About 4 months total.

**7\. Why This Matters Now**

You're expanding. More branches means more transactions, more staff, more places for things to go wrong.

With DriveStream, leakage scales with volume. With a proper system, you scale operations without scaling problems.

**8\. Beyond Focal Point**

The problems you're solving (leakage, tracking, staff accountability, payment assurance) exist at every dry cleaner in Nigeria. Most are running on paper, WhatsApp, and hope.

Once this system is running at Focal Point, you'll have:

* A proven, battle-tested product  
* Your own operations as the reference case  
* The ability to license, white-label, or sell to competitors

The ₦20M isn't just an operational investment. It's a product acquisition.

**9\. Next Steps**

* Confirm scope  
* We map your workflow in detail (1 week)  
* Development begins  
* Live in \~4 months

**Summary**

| Problem | Leakage, limited visibility, DriveStream gaps |
| :---- | :---- |
| Solution | System that tracks everything, blocks unpaid releases, logs all actions |
| Investment | ₦20,000,000 |
| Timeline | 4 months |

Let us know if you want to move forward or if there's anything to adjust.

**Date: November 2025**

# **1\. Your Current Situation**

Hotels like Mont Kalm operate in a fast-moving environment where customer expectations keep rising — yet most systems remain outdated or scattered. Today, your team likely faces challenges such as:

* Bookings coming in from WhatsApp, calls, walk-ins, and Instagram — difficult to track and easy to miss  
* Double-booking or booking conflicts caused by manual entries  
* Guests abandoning bookings because the process is too long or inconvenient  
* Staff manually reminding guests, confirming payments, sending details  
* No centralized overview of occupancy, revenue, or booking trends  
* Missed follow-ups when guests fail to complete a booking  
* No modern digital experience to match your brand’s physical quality

**Individually, these issues may look small.**  
 **Together, they cause lost revenue every single day.**

# **2\. Your Risk of Doing Nothing**

Without a modern booking and management system:

* Customers will continue to choose hotels with easier online booking  
* Staff workload increases while efficiency decreases  
* Payment delays remain common  
* Booking conflicts frustrate guests and damage brand trust  
* Management continues operating “blindfolded” without real-time insight  
* Competitors who automate will outpace you in December peak season and beyond

**Doing nothing now means losing market share to hotels running on automation, clarity, and speed.**
