# Proposal for Yanna Apartments
## Hospitality Automation & Revenue Recovery System

**Presented by: Algolog Limited (Spacer Systems)**  
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Yanna Apartments currently operates on a global platform, but one that requires manual keycard programming for every guest and redirects online bookings to an external site. Both introduce unnecessary delay, cost, and complexity to your operations.

We propose migrating to **Spacer** — a hospitality automation system built specifically for Nigerian operators who want full control over their spaces, payments, and smart devices, without dependency on foreign systems.

Spacer keeps everything your team is used to (online booking, guest management, analytics) but adds automated door access, local control, and real-time support from our Nigerian engineering team.

## Current Challenges

### The Friday Night Reality

It's 11:30 PM. Three guests arrive after delayed flights. Your receptionist, already managing check-ins, now faces the keycard programmer.

Guest 1's card programs fine. Guest 2's takes three attempts. Guest 3's machine freezes.

Twenty-five minutes later, three exhausted travelers finally get keys. One posts to Google that night: *"Long wait just for a key."*

This isn't unusual at Yanna. This is Tuesday.

Your staff aren't incompetent — they're fighting a system that wastes their time and frustrates your guests.

---

### Four Areas of Operational Drain

#### **1. Manual Door Access Management**

Your staff spend 8-10 minutes per guest programming keycards:

- With approximately 400 check-ins/month, that's 4,000 minutes
- Over 200 hours monthly on repetitive, low-value work
- Equivalent to **₦500,000/month in lost productivity**

#### **2. Booking Conversion Loss**

Your website redirects users to an external booking portal:

- Guests drop off when redirected, especially on mobile
- Hotels typically lose 25-40% of potential conversions from such redirects
- Every 10 lost bookings per month at ₦40K = **₦400,000 in potential monthly losses**

#### **3. Card Management Overhead**

Manual card systems create ongoing costs:

- Lost keycards requiring replacement
- Card programming equipment maintenance
- No digital audit trail when issues occur
- **Estimated ₦50,000+/month in related costs**
- Each guest complaint about access issues impacts your online reputation

#### **4. Foreign Provider Dependency**

You currently rely on foreign software providers:

- Bug fixes and feature requests take weeks or months
- Support operates in different time zones
- No understanding of Nigerian context (NEPA outages, local payment systems)
- **Ongoing subscription fees: ₦100,000+/month**
- You're on their roadmap, not in control of yours

### Annual Impact

| Challenge Area | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Lost Productivity | ₦500,000 | ₦6,000,000 |
| Booking Conversion Loss | ₦400,000 | ₦4,800,000 |
| Card Management | ₦50,000 | ₦600,000 |
| Foreign Subscription & Support | ₦100,000 | ₦1,200,000 |
| **Total** | **₦1,050,000** | **₦12,600,000** |

This isn't just inconvenient — it's measurably expensive and slowing your operations.

## A Similar Success Story: Zenith Suites

Before proposing our solution, let us share a recent implementation similar to your situation.

### Zenith Suites, Wuse II

**Their Starting Point:**
- 24-unit serviced apartment property
- 300 check-ins per month
- 45+ hours weekly spent on keycard management
- Staff burnout and guest complaints
- Sound familiar?

**The Spacer Implementation:**
- **Day 1:** Lock compatibility assessment (30 minutes)
- **Day 3:** System installed on 3 pilot rooms
- **Day 5:** Staff completed training (2 hours)
- **Day 7:** Full property went live

**Results After 90 Days:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Average check-in time | 8-10 minutes | 90 seconds | 90% reduction |
| Weekly staff hours on cards | 45 hours | 0 hours | Eliminated |
| Monthly access errors | 2-3 incidents | 0 incidents | Eliminated |
| Google review rating | 3.8 stars | 4.6 stars | +0.8 improvement |

**From their Operations Manager:**

> *"We thought we needed more staff. We just needed smarter systems. Spacer freed our team to actually serve guests instead of fighting keycard machines."*  
> — Tunde Bakare, Zenith Suites

### This Could Be Yanna in 90 Days

Same Friday night, seven days after Spacer deployment:

11:30 PM. Three guests arrive.

Your receptionist taps three buttons. Three access codes generate instantly and send to guest emails.

Check-in complete: 90 seconds total.

Your receptionist uses the saved 20 minutes to prepare welcome drinks and personally show guests to their rooms.

Next morning's review: *"Smoothest check-in ever!"*

The difference? Your team has freedom to create exceptional experiences instead of fighting technology.

## The Spacer Solution

Spacer isn't just a replacement for your current system — it's a complete evolution designed specifically for Nigerian hospitality operations.

### Smart Door Access Automation

Spacer integrates directly with your existing locks:

**The Guest Journey:**
1. Guest completes booking → System instantly generates unique digital access code
2. Code automatically sent to guest's email with check-in instructions
3. Guest arrives and uses code to unlock door (no staff interaction needed)
4. Code automatically expires at checkout time
5. All access activity logged in real-time for management review

**Result:** Zero manual keycard programming. Zero access mix-ups. Complete guest convenience.

### Direct Booking Platform

Everything your current system provides — optimized for Nigeria:

- **Seamless Booking:** Guests book directly on your site with no redirects
- **Local Payments:** Integrated with Paystack for instant verification
- **Offline Capability:** Staff can check in walk-in guests when network fluctuates
- **Automatic Documentation:** Receipts and invoices generated for each transaction
- **Gallery Showcase:** Clean visual presentation of your apartments

### Management Dashboard

Real-time visibility and control:

- Live occupancy overview (booked vs. available)
- Revenue analytics (daily, weekly, monthly breakdowns)
- Staff activity monitoring
- Alert center for key events (bookings, check-ins, code expirations)
- Complete access logs for security and audit purposes

### Local Engineering Support

Unlike global platforms, Spacer is built and managed by Algolog Limited in Nigeria:

- 24/7 access to our engineering team
- On-site setup and staff training in Abuja
- Custom feature requests implemented in days, not months
- Offline mode designed for NEPA realities
- Native understanding of Nigerian business operations

When you need help, you call Tolu (our Lead Engineer), not a call center in Manila.

## Q4 2025 Implementation Capacity

We maintain a white-glove implementation approach that includes:
- Custom lock assessment for your specific hardware
- On-site installation by our engineering team
- Personalized staff training
- 30 days of dedicated support

This level of service requires dedicated engineering time.

**Current Q4 Status:**
- Slot 1: ✓ Committed (Lagos boutique hotel)
- Slot 2: ✓ Committed (Abuja serviced apartments)
- Slot 3: Available (Yanna + 1 other expressing interest)

**Next availability after Q4: March 2026**

### Opportunity Cost of Delay

If implementation waits until March 2026:

- November to March = 5 months
- Your monthly operating cost = ₦1,050,000
- **Total cost of delay = ₦5,250,000**

That's ₦5.25 million in continued inefficiency for a decision delay.

- Each week of delay = ₦262,500
- Each day of delay = ₦37,500

We don't share this to pressure you — we share it so you understand the math of the decision timeline.
